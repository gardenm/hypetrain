On DeMarco's other 2012 record, the EP &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16476-rock-and-roll-night-club/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rock and Roll Night Club&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he tinkered with yacht rock, AM radio gold, and Bowie-like glam. The mixture injected an unsettling sleaziness into a funny, occasionally creepy collection of songs that walked the line between irony and sincerity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In contrast, &lt;i&gt;2 &lt;/i&gt;goes right for the gut. DeMarco writes about life-- both the heavy moments and the mundane ones-- with economy and newfound grace. He's still not entirely upfront, but he has a knack for building songs where the realness of his subject matter lies just below the surface. In a Pitchfork &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/8956-mac-demarco/" target="_blank"&gt;guest list&lt;/a&gt; from earlier in October, DeMarco cites Jonathan Richman as a role model, mostly because he felt that Richman had "a very enjoyable time his whole life." Richman is an expert at writing entire worlds into his songs, an approach that DeMarco nails on &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Opening track "Cooking Up Something Good" is a strong example of his approach. A loose instrumental vamp slides into a greasy guitar line, as his laconic, sleepy voice delivers subtly heartbreaking observations. "Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good/ And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood". When the chorus comes in ("Oh, when life moves this slowly/ Oh, just try and let it go"), it's blindsiding, and his sense of defeat is palpable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;As the song progresses it becomes clear that what initially felt like an ode to the frustrating teenage days of struggling against your suburban surroundings is actually about a father figure manufacturing drugs in the basement. "Cooking Up Something Good" is about boredom and sadness and our skewed perception of time, but it's also about family secrets and how we construct emotional escape hatches to get away from the inescapable realities of blood ties. This careful world-building continues across the entire album, sometimes with a lighter touch. DeMarco's thinly veiled honesty shows up prominently on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14383-ode-to-viceroy/" target="_blank"&gt;"Ode to Viceroy"&lt;/a&gt; where, over an unsettling guitar flange that fizzles into a flat shimmer, he sings about how much he loves smoking cigarettes. His voice skirts the edge of disinterest, but never quite gets there. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;After spending time with &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;, DeMarco's vocal deadpan starts to sound weary and wise. On &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13947-my-kind-of-woman/" target="_blank"&gt;"My Kind of Woman"&lt;/a&gt;, he effectively makes a prom love song that will never get played at any actual prom-- it oozes beautifully simple and direct sentiment: "You're my kind of woman/ And I'm down on my hands and knees begging you please, baby, show me your world." That last line, "show me your world," returns to the concept that DeMarco and the people he sings about are all living, breathing entities, not blank slates to project emotion on. When they're gone from DeMarco's life, they still exist. It doesn't really get more honest than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/K2yGrjSxs-w" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sam Hockley-Smith</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17182-mac-demarco-2/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17182-mac-demarco-2/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Andy Stott: Luxury Problems</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/wXjgGVbodiU/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Andy-Stott/262174253793725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andy Stott&lt;/a&gt; took his time getting here. The Manchester producer spent a good part of the last decade turning out solid tracks under his own name and under the alias Andrea. Though he always returned to dub techno, he flirted with a range of genres, from juke to house to dubstep, and some of his music was very good. But Stott never quite zeroed in on a unique voice. That changed in 2011 with the release of two short albums, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Passed Me By&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Stay Together&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Stott left behind the quicker tempos of dance proper, and slowing down allowed him to sink deeper into his music, where he found a new world of atmosphere and texture. &lt;i&gt;Passed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stay&lt;/i&gt; were &lt;i&gt;heavy&lt;/i&gt; records that highlighted something new about the expressive power of bass. Dub techno, stretching back to its origins with the early-1990s Berlin project &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"&gt;Basic Channel&lt;/a&gt;, tends to view the low end as a mysterious black sludge. Where bass in &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"&gt;Skrillex&lt;/a&gt;-style EDM is a precision weapon, with drops punctuating the tracks and jacking up the mood in an instant, the bottom octave in dub techno is more of an enveloping presence. It's murkier, more oppressive, colder, something you wade through and push against. Which is why the inertia of the relentless 4/4 beat signifies energy whatever the tempo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his two 2011 releases, Stott found an unusual musicality in deep, foreboding bass. His music throbbed with the sooty remnants of industry and had obvious appeal for those interested in dark ambiance of any stripe; its all-consuming nature gave him a new audience beyond the realm of dance music. With his new album, &lt;i&gt;Luxury Problems&lt;/i&gt;, he adds a few more wrinkles, and his music has become simultaneously more complex and more accessible. Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore (&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8973-andy-stott/"&gt;Stott met her&lt;/a&gt; as a student when she taught him piano), he's humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward for the producer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skidmore's voice is a versatile instrument in its own right, but Stott's looping and processing gives it even more flexibility. Though &lt;i&gt;Luxury Problems&lt;/i&gt; has a consistent overall mood, the feel and structure of the individual tracks vary quite a bit, and the pieces featuring Skidmore find her singing pulled into all kinds of interesting shapes. The album opens with her in her most glassy and ethereal, as repetitions of her singing a single word, "touch," float through space like soap bubbles. The "ch" phoneme is looped and becomes the hi-hat on the track, and gradually the sounds assemble themselves into a ghosted version of a conventional dance rhythm. But when Stott's machine bass pulse enters just under halfway through, we realize we're in for a world of serious contrasts: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14306-numb/" target="_blank"&gt;"Numb"&lt;/a&gt; is delicate and gorgeous but has an undercurrent of menace, and the tension between these qualities is the record's essence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If "Numb" is Skidmore at her most spectral, "Hatch the Plan" finds her sounding more grounded, almost in the mode of a singer-songwriter. The choral-like layering on "Plan" brings to mind School of Seven Bells and even Throwing Muses. But it's the longest track on the record and is purely instrumental-- mostly a deeply unsettling mix of bass churn and machine noises-- for its first two minutes. That it moves from pure soundscape to something close to a proper song is further evidence of Stott's confidence; none of these tracks feel like they have to be any one thing, they're always growing and changing and defying expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Lost and Found" has a similarly melodic approach, unspooling in a Middle Eastern mode and bringing to mind &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"&gt;Dead Can Dance&lt;/a&gt; at their most subtle. We can hear Stott drawing lines between 4AD-style gothic new wave and dub techno, building bridges between sounds and ideas based on his understanding of the elements and moods that connect them. Elsewhere, on "Expecting", he goes further into abstraction, constructing an intensely dark and ominous atmosphere that bring to mind the ice-cold isolationist drone of &lt;a href="http://www.koener.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thomas Köner&lt;/a&gt;. The excavation of electronic music history takes a more unusual turn on "Up the Box", which plays with a snippet of what sounds like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the "Amen" break&lt;/a&gt;. But the familiar splash of jungle snares and cymbals is transformed by Stott into something of his own own, as he mixes the tricky rhythms with his now undeniable bass signature, a groaning maw flecked with distortion that feels like it's rattling everything within earshot. Stott has a rare ability to pull sounds from different places and fit them into his album conception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two records from the past offer antecedents for Stott's breakthrough: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2560-luomo/"&gt;Luomo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vocalcity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"&gt;Burial&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Untrue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's not that &lt;i&gt;Luxury Problems&lt;/i&gt; sounds like either of these releases-- the mood and textures are vastly different in each case. But there's a spiritual connection between the three, all of which found producers working within the confines of a specific genre of electronic music discovering a way to turn their music inside and out and broaden its appeal through the manipulated voice. But if &lt;i&gt;Vocalcity&lt;/i&gt; was a digital refraction of house music and &lt;i&gt;Untrue&lt;/i&gt; took early UK dubstep as a jumping-off point to express post-club emptiness and yearning, &lt;i&gt;Luxury Problems&lt;/i&gt; is more internally focused, an evocative and immersive soundtrack for a sustained look within. It's the headphones album of the year from a producer with a long history who has come into his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/wXjgGVbodiU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mark Richardson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Kendrick Lamar: good kid, m.A.A.d city</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/8vAXgjaWdFQ/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The first sound we hear on &lt;i&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d. city&lt;/i&gt; is a prayer: "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood," voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar" target="_blank"&gt;Kendrick&lt;/a&gt; dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Lamar has subtitled the record "A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar", and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick "with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental," driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: "It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb," he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that &lt;i&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d city&lt;/i&gt; is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;All this weighty material might make &lt;i&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d city&lt;/i&gt; sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14459-backseat-freestyle/" target="_blank"&gt;"Backseat Freestyle"&lt;/a&gt; leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter ("All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his "damn, I got bitches" chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pass at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When "The Art of Peer Pressure" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37wSwAJ98Zk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;hallowed ground&lt;/a&gt;. Ice Cube’s &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU8H9_YBM3A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Bird in the Hand”&lt;/a&gt; is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad..."), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: "I made a promise to see you bleeding," he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, "Wake yo' punk ass up," like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample ("Poetic Justice") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/48051-new-kendrick-lamar-featuring-dr-dre-compton/" target="_blank"&gt;"Compton"&lt;/a&gt;, that feels like an uneasy outlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;"Compton" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain &lt;i&gt;Truman Show&lt;/i&gt; feel to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;But the &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; ending of &lt;i&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d. city&lt;/i&gt; takes place at the end of the previous song, "Real", which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that "none of that shit"-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- "make me real," Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: "Any nigga can kill a man," his father admonishes. "That don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family." And his mother: "If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And that's the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/8vAXgjaWdFQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jayson Greene</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Bat For Lashes: The Haunted Man</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/y-y4PgbjWiA/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Natasha Khan has said her third album as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/" target="_blank"&gt;Bat for Lashes&lt;/a&gt; is partly inspired by studying her own family history. This is informative. Her father, a trainer for the Pakistani national squash team, left suddenly when she was 11, and his departure casts a shadow on the fairytale drama of Bat for Lashes' debut, 2006's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9855-fur-gold/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fur and Gold&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, but one of the guys Khan's dad coached? Her cousin, Jahangir Khan? He went on to become a six-time world champion and basically his sport's equivalent of a Pelé or Michael Jordan. You don't need Natasha's Ancestry.com password to know there's competitive drive in her blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's her up there in &lt;i&gt;The Haunted Man&lt;/i&gt; cover art. Naked, un-retouched, and un-made-up, with a similarly naked man draped around her shoulders. The suggestion is that her follow-up to 2009's lavishly sensual &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12910-two-suns/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two Suns&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is more intimate and stripped bare, and sure enough, there's less reverb on Khan's voice, and the lyrical concerns have moved from an otherworldly New York to the English countryside. But what the Ryan McGinley-shot art most closely shares with the music you'll find within is that it's at once striking and enigmatic-- and artfully constructed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some albums sound effortless. &lt;i&gt;The Haunted Man&lt;/i&gt; sounds like effort magnificently realized. The rawness of feeling is achieved through equally raw ambition. Bat for Lashes' sophisticated blend of art-rock grandeur and synth-pop directness again carries echoes of 1980s luminaries like Kate Bush and the Cure, gleaming with autoharp, Abbey Road-recorded strings, and a continuing exploration of electronics. Spacious, boldly orchestrated, and emotionally rich, Khan's latest is another step forward for the multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter, and one of the year's most beguiling albums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two Suns&lt;/i&gt;' sublime, &lt;i&gt;Karate Kid&lt;/i&gt;-nodding &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11161-daniel/" target="_blank"&gt;"Daniel"&lt;/a&gt; won Britain's Ivor Novello songwriting award. The potential hits here are just as overpowering. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11928-lets-get-lost/" target="_blank"&gt;"Let's Get Lost"&lt;/a&gt;, the sumptuous slab of goth-bubblegum Khan did with Beck for 2011's &lt;i&gt;Twilight: Eclipse &lt;/i&gt;OST, was a promising sign of what to expect. On slinky, guitar-centric &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47895-listen-bat-for-lashes-all-your-gold/" target="_blank"&gt;"All Your Gold"&lt;/a&gt;, Khan is the one who's haunted, but it only takes a few listens before Gotye's awfully similar smash sounds fleshless in comparison. "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14228-marilyn/" target="_blank"&gt;Marilyn"&lt;/a&gt; adapts the 1950s matinee-idolatry of Lana Del Rey to a dream-pop production worthy of its "silver screen," with a staggering, spectral bridge-- and several instrumental contributions from Beck (plus arranging by ex-Ash member Charlotte Hatherley).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though sometimes over-reaching, the less likely singles here are as darkly enigmatic, sonically curious, and thematically textured as their equivalents on &lt;i&gt;Two Suns&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The centerpiece is the title track, with its "Scarborough Fair"-tinged male choir marching up that distant hill. "Yes, your ghosts have got me, too/ But it's me and you," Khan replies, summing up the album's main conceit: the way previous experiences can twist our current relationships. On M83-gauzy, Dave Sitek-assisted opener "Lilies", though, "the figure of a man" answers a life-affirming, womanly prayer. Druid-like male voices on "Oh Yeah" introduce the poised yet passionate exultation of a narrator "in bloom." As on the album cover, Khan's music can acknowledge the female body without reducing it to sex-kitten cliché.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, if the last album was about contrasts-- between two suns, two lovers, even two sides of the narrator's persona-- then &lt;i&gt;The Haunted Man&lt;/i&gt; is defined by balance, between the bare and the polished, between the communal and the personal, and between the respective ghosts haunting our personal interactions. Compromises can lead to breakthroughs: "Where you see a wall, I see a door," Khan sings on "A Wall", another Sitek-backed, baroque synth-pop anthem. By the restrained yet intricate closing lullaby "Deep Sea Diver", which meets the bar set by &lt;i&gt;Two Suns&lt;/i&gt;' collaborative finale with famously reclusive crooner Scott Walker, Khan finds a compromise for two people separated by masks: "Darling if you can't see out/ You know that I can hear you shout." They're together, alone, shaking through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most overtly naked track here, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13918-laura/" target="_blank"&gt;"Laura"&lt;/a&gt;, is also the most transcendent. With a gently orchestra-kissed piano-and-voice arrangement, this goosebump-inducing collaboration with the former Lizzy Grant's "Video Games" co-writer Justin Parker is the clearest example of how Bat for Lashes perches on the fulcrum between indie-associated sincerity and pop-oriented savvy. We'll never know Laura, really, but we can feel what it might be like to know her. On an album with more names in the credits than Khan could ever use for song titles (also including Portishead's Adrian Utley, among many others), the greatest testament to her strength of will might be just this: She has added a new unforgettable character to pop's family tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/y-y4PgbjWiA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Marc Hogan</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17174-the-haunted-man/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17174-the-haunted-man/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Godspeed You! Black Emperor: Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/m9n1oZnw8rE/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Around the turn of the millennium, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"&gt;Godspeed You! Black Emperor&lt;/a&gt; were the right band at the right time. They arrived with their debut album,&lt;i&gt; F#A#∞&lt;/i&gt;, in 1997, when the speed of technology was accelerating, genres were being shuffled, and people were thinking about where music might go. Godspeed, a loose and mysterious collective from Canada (guitarist &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29658-efrim-manuck/"&gt;Efrim Menuck&lt;/a&gt; seemed like the leader, but they preferred to be received as a unit) with an anarchist political bent who fused &lt;a href="http://www.enniomorricone.it/uk/news.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ennio Morricone&lt;/a&gt;, minimalism, found sound, and metal-inflected noise, presented one intriguing possibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group stayed busy during its initial run-- by 2002, when they released &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3487-yanqui-uxo/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yanqui U.X.O.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they had put out three expansive full-lengths and a long EP-- and then they put Godspeed on the shelf and went away for a while. If they'd never gotten back together and had never released another note of music, it wouldn't have mattered. Their legacy was secure. But Godspeed &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/38440-godspeed-you-black-emperor-return/"&gt;started playing live again &lt;/a&gt;in 2010 and, just as it was when they first came on the scene, they filled a hole in music that we either didn't know existed or had forgotten about. Then, two weeks ago, came the surprise announcement of a new album, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/48130-stream-godspeed-you-black-emperors-new-album/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, their first in exactly 10 years. Once again, their timing is impeccable. If Godspeed around the turn of the millennium felt like a band of the moment, now, in a time of rapid cultural turnover and bite-sized music consumption, they feel out of step in a very necessary way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's tempting to look at &lt;i&gt;Allelujah!&lt;/i&gt; through the lens of politics, especially since Godspeed themselves have so often encouraged this viewpoint. When we last heard from them on record, it was a year after 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan was well underway, and the war in Iraq was just around the corner. We were settling into a decade that was, from an American perspective, defined by two wars started by an increasingly unpopular president and an inflating economic bubble that would pop just as he was leaving office. Their music and presentation drew some of its energy from this anxiety. So listening to new music from Godspeed now-- during an election season, when the wars and the aftermath of that economy are still being argued every day by two presidential candidates grappling with the legacy of the early 2000s-- you can't help but allow the political moment to shape how it's heard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the focus on the band's politics obscures something important: Godspeed You! Black Emperor are making art, not writing editorials. And the fact that they are making art gives them leeway to do things that wouldn't work in the context of pure rhetoric. It allows them to find magnificence in destruction and build an aesthetic out of decay and loss. So for all their political slogans, pointed titles, and references to global doom, engagement with Godspeed's music can feel exceedingly personal. When listening to their music, I'm not necessarily thinking about the downtrodden transcending their place in the capitalist hierarchy or the end of the world; I'm thinking about the &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; of transcendence, the raw grace of noise, and the tragedy of endings. Godspeed's music works so brilliantly because it can be abstracted and scaled, blown up into an edifice that towers over a continent or shrunk down to something that feels at home in a bedroom. So mapping the contours of their grand music onto your own ordinary life can feel both natural and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two lengthy tracks on &lt;i&gt;Allelujah!&lt;/i&gt;, "Mladic" and "We Drift Like Worried Fire", have been part of the band's live repertoire since 2003. So the record feels in one sense like Godspeed taking care of unfinished business, presenting existing music from their influential run in a context that showcases its full force and power. Taken together, those tracks serve as a 40-minute summary of everything that made this band great. "Mladic" is all gloom and menace, building from an opening vocal snippet, adding pings of guitar, strings that saw away in a Middle Eastern mode, and dark clouds of feedback. This is the Godspeed that learned so much from the pummeling repetition of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"&gt;Swans&lt;/a&gt; and the fiendish drama of metal. There's not exactly &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; in a track like "Mladic", but there is a kind of darkly shaded catharsis. Godspeed have never sounded quite this heavy, and it's especially impressive in how far it can veer from the themes that hold it together without losing the thread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We Drift Like Worried Fire" is the flip-side of "Mladic", both literally and figuratively. For all their grim black-and-white roadside imagery and scenes of destruction, it can be easy to overlook just how joyful Godspeed's music can be. Built around a simple guitar motif consisting of just a few notes, "Worried Fire" is one of those accruing pieces that gathers one element after another for 10 minutes until it's so gorgeous you almost can't take it. And at exactly that moment, Godspeed pause and then push the music over the top with an explosion of guitar that snaps everything that came before into focus. "Worried Fire" is music that makes you forget about politics and the machinations of the record business and the bullshit of internet chatter and brings you into singularity with the sheer beauty of their sound, music to make you cry with a smile on your face. When it's playing, the rest of the world goes away for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Worried Fire" is also the kind of song that Godspeed's early peers (&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"&gt;Mogwai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"&gt;Dirty Three&lt;/a&gt;) as well as the bands that followed (&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"&gt;Explosions in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;) write with some regularity, but they never quite hit these heights. Godspeed have always been about more than volume, more than just addition and subtraction. And if &lt;i&gt;Yanqui&lt;/i&gt; found them getting a little too close to their descendants, &lt;i&gt;Allelujah!&lt;/i&gt; makes clear that Godspeed will always own this sound. Few can match their feel for arrangement or sense of structure. And the two shorter tracks on this album, "Their Helicopters' Sing" and "Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable", are evidence of their infallible ear for texture. They're both rich, dense drones, "Helicopter" an especially thick mix of feedback and accordion while "Strung Like Lights" is airier and more unstable, not unlike the locked groove that came at the second side of their debut &lt;i&gt;F#A#∞&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one of the many inserts that came with the vinyl version of that debut, there's a &lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vRmQe1R6rFc/UHuJBSI-PcI/AAAAAAAAMqU/d-5UNlD_S2Q/s1024/godspeed-fa-infinity.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;diagram&lt;/a&gt; that takes the form of an architectural blueprint. It's called "Faulty Schematics of Ruined Machine [to Scale]" and it contains a drawing with four axes marked as Fear, Hope, Desire, and Regret and text describing elements of the diagram in cryptic and desperate language. One paragraph highlights a drawing of a tape loop connected between a distant satellite and a broken tape machine, a loop "so long it was rocketed thru atmosphere by wigged-out Soviet Cosmonaut... it will take three lifetimes to hear in its entirety." Godspeed use tape loops, both live and on record, and the key visual element of their shows involves the projection of 16mm film loops by collective member Karl Lemieux. For this band, there's always been something appealing about repeating cycles and rituals-- sounds and images that vanish over the horizon and then come back around again, like the trains that roll by their practice space at Hotel 2 Tango. Planets orbit, people are born and die, and music has a moment and then vanishes before returning again. And so it goes with &lt;i&gt;Allelujah!&lt;/i&gt;, an album of music that is both new and old from a band that we thought we might never hear from again, one we should appreciate while we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/m9n1oZnw8rE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mark Richardson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Converge: All We Love We Leave Behind</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/Ucx2crK-SO8/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The brilliant hardcore band &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/" target="_blank"&gt;Converge&lt;/a&gt; have been around a long time, though you might not guess it from the manic energy crammed into their eighth album, &lt;i&gt;All We Love We Leave Behind&lt;/i&gt;. If you go beyond the amped, break-neck intensity and listen to the compositions, it becomes clear the Boston band is nearing the 25-year mark: You don't just show up and write songs like this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the quartet's not-so-secret weapons is Kurt Ballou, the guitarist (and backing vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, etc.), who happens to be one of the most well-regarded engineers in heavy music and an endless tinkerer who'd build a snare from scratch if it meant getting the sound he needed. The central core of vocalist/in-house artist Jacob Bannon and Ballou-- along with bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller, who both joined in 1999-- have been together long enough to know each other very well, and to play almost entirely to their own strengths. As such, there's never a dull moment across &lt;i&gt;AWLWLB&lt;/i&gt;'s 38 minutes. It's all peaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The record is the logical followup to 2009's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13625-axe-to-fall/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Axe to Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite record that year. &lt;i&gt;Axe&lt;/i&gt; included a large supporting cast of friends and fellow travelers from Cave In, Disfear, Genghis Tron, the Red Chord, and Neurosis. It ended with a seven-minute song that seemed to include them all. When I &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8950-times-arrow/" target="_blank"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; with Converge frontman Jacob Bannon a few weeks ago about &lt;i&gt;AWLWLB&lt;/i&gt;, he said &lt;i&gt;Axe to Fall&lt;/i&gt; had been the "collaborative concept taken to the extreme." This time, it's just the band and the watchful ear of Ballou. As Bannon put it, "There's no artificial distortion, triggers, or Auto-Tune on this album. It's all organic, it's real sounds that capture the way the band performs live."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From opener (and first single) &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14119-aimless-arrow/" target="_blank"&gt;"Aimless Arrow"&lt;/a&gt; onward, the music here is mostly fast, compact, and coiled. That's Converge in general, but they've distilled the elements to even tauter extremes this time. The technical mastery is mind-blowing, as is the way they manage to squeeze in brutal melodies and hooks. The vocal lines seem to be woven into the guitars, to which they've also added a bluesier feel, a detail that reminds me of the classic post-Negative Approach Touch and Go band Laughing Hyenas-- or even the Jesus Lizard. It's a streamlined, live-sounding collection that can feel like one giant kick to the head. But they know when to give, take, and plop in a slow-grind blues riff. Tracks overlap and echo. When they slow things down to a momentary crawl with the album's longest song, the five-minute doom ballad "Coral Blue", it's like a chair's been pulled out from behind you. You get that in the middle of the two-minute "Empty on the Inside" as well as the instrumental "Precipice", an interstitial piece with piano, clean guitars, psychedelic soloing guitars, and deep-factory/chain-gang percussion. "All We Love We Leave Behind" picks all of that up gorgeously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As overwhelming as &lt;i&gt;AWLWLB&lt;/i&gt; may be on first listen, it's really &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; all speed. There's a thing people say about young professional quarterbacks, about how they need experience before the game "slows down." You get that on this album, too. In my interview with Bannon, he said: "I feel that the current generation of listeners of heavy music are progressing a bit past their gateway bands and are digging deeper than they used to and understanding more abrasive and complex music and art. It's like being around an unfamiliar language long enough that it eventually begins to make sense." I agree with this, and it's the reason why Converge are a band with plenty of fans who weren't close to being born when the band formed in 1990.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, there's plenty for older audiences, too-- aging, death, decisions, punk as a way of life, and the way these things preoccupy you when you go past 30 are largely what this album is about. (It all opens with "Aimless Arrow"'s "To live the life you want/ You've abandoned those in need"). Bannon describes the grizzled two-minute anthem &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14300-shame-in-the-way/" target="_blank"&gt;"Shame in the Way"&lt;/a&gt; as a song about "feeling fragmented from the traditional concept of family." He adds, "As I've gotten older, I've worked on mending the things I can, while being conscious of the things I can't repair." You get this on the genuinely moving title track, too. Bannon calls it "an open letter to the things that I feel I've left behind in order to pursue an artistic and musical direction in my life." He says it was inspired in part by the death of his beloved dog, Anna Belle, but there's a lot more than that here: It's a classic hardcore anthem, one that looks at the decision to live a life in a particular way, and it might bring you to tears if you hear it right. Really, more than the past couple of Converge albums, &lt;i&gt;AWLWLB&lt;/i&gt; feels like a hardcore record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We live in a period of compression, where there's more stimulation and less time for reflection-- but we're also continually presented with a repackaged, slightly off past. Nostalgia is music's biggest seller, it seems. The thing is, underground bands that formed in 1990 are often getting back together in 2012 for reunion tours, not eighth albums. The irony of the title, of course, is that Converge are also a lesson in not leaving behind what matters. "Predatory Glow" ends the record with the lines: "Let the future know/ I won't be there tomorrow/ Let the past know/ I gave them my all/ I'm aching for an end/ Grown thinner every day/ I bow down to you/ Extinguished youth." When I asked about the song, Bannon explained: "I am far from an 'old' person in human terms, however I've spent over half my life immersed in the punk rock and hardcore community. I am not wholly defined by that as a person, but it is something that has been part of me for a long time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it will be, until he dies. &lt;i&gt;AWLWLB&lt;/i&gt; is an example of building on and mastering the music you loved when you were younger-- something that became more than music, ultimately-- so that it has a chance to grow old with you without becoming any less vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/Ucx2crK-SO8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brandon Stosuy</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17132-all-we-love-we-leave-behind/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17132-all-we-love-we-leave-behind/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Metz: Metz</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/wG6Q3iGbVlY/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest lie about punk rock is that anyone can do it. Sure, anyone can do &lt;i&gt;crap&lt;/i&gt; punk rock, but there is a fine to art to taking a music fueled by destructive impulses and building it to last. Toronto power trio &lt;a href="http://www.subpop.com/bio/metz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt; played their first show in late 2007, and since then, they've effectively applied Malcolm Gladwell's &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/outliers_excerpt1.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; about the Beatles-- i.e., that it takes a good 10,000 hours of practice to become them-- to a subgenre not exactly known for its studiousness: post-hardcore sludge-punk. That five-year gap between their live and recorded debuts is not a product of laziness, but rather precision; while Metz quickly established themselves as the most brutalizing band in the city, the process of translating that essence into a record that would sound every bit as devastating and disorienting outside the confines of a circle pit was more protracted and deliberate. After a couple of small-run 7"'s, and a series of sessions helmed by producers including Owen Pallett/Dusted associate Leon Taheny, Crystal Castles engineer Alex Bonenfant, and Graham Walsh of Holy Fuck, they've distilled their set-list standards into 29 minutes of pure but artfully rendered chaos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Nothings&lt;/a&gt;'&lt;i&gt; In Utero&lt;/i&gt;'d pop-punk to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/" target="_blank"&gt;Japandroids&lt;/a&gt;' Superchunk-gone-Springsteen heroics to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/" target="_blank"&gt;the Men&lt;/a&gt;'s My Bloody Dinosaur overdrive, 2012 has seen no lack of artists revamping 1990s-vintage indie rock with a more anthemic accessibility and better mastering jobs. Metz pull off the same trick, but work with more angular, insoluble materials: namely, the muscular menace of the Jesus Lizard and the relentless, power-drill discord of Drive Like Jehu. Metz songs tend to start with an isolated element-- Hayden Menzies' thundering, hammer-of-the-gods drum salvos, Alex Edkins' solitary guitar screech-- that immediately triggers a ticking time-bomb countdown for the moment when the band erupts in unison. You can see the storm coming from a mile atway, and yet, when Menzies, Edkins, and bassist Chris Slorach launch into the merciless, firestorm battering of "Negative Space" or the wrecking-ball swing of "Knife in the Water", it still startles like a sneak attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while it ably captures the band's ferocity, &lt;i&gt;Metz&lt;/i&gt; is less a recreation of the band's live shows than a surveillance-video document of it, one that's been edited and manipulated to maximize dynamic impact. There's a surface graininess that amplifies the corrosive qualities of the band's sound and the strep-throat rawness of Edkins' voice, but also serves to accentuate some of the more surprising elements in the mix-- like the ascendant "ahhhhh" harmonies that provide a two-second respite from the village-pillaging assault of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13848-headache/" target="_blank"&gt;"Headache"&lt;/a&gt;. The title of that song and others like "Rats", "Nausea", and "Sad Pricks" provide a handy summation of Edkins' bleak lyrical concerns, but that misanthropy never weighs the album down. Instead, like a pre-fame Kurt Cobain, Edkins channels his anxieties into manic release with a certain insolent swagger: In "Wasted", you get a glimpse of what Nirvana would've sounded like had they recorded their follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Bleach&lt;/i&gt; for Touch and Go instead of Geffen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though unafraid to temper their inherent ugliness with piano taps and tambourine shakes, Metz stop short of embracing traditional pop-song melody. But they do understand pop-song economy, carefully arranging their riffs, rhythms, and screams in two-to-three-minute bursts that still feel immediate and catchy in the absence of proper sing-along hooks. Live, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14249-wet-blanket/" target="_blank"&gt;"Wet Blanket"&lt;/a&gt;'s psych-damaged fuzz-bass breakdown often gets stretched out, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po0RTKjsC8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"You Made Me Realise"-style&lt;/a&gt;; on record, it emerges as a tightly wound beast, with a white-knuckled finale that craftily blurs the line between the band's natural, primal energy and studio-tweaked trickery. Recent history is rife with home-recording prodigies who get thrust onto the stage before learning how to perform, or promising live acts who rush-release their albums so that they have something to sell at the merch table, or at least a Soundcloud link to pimp. But while evidence suggests great concerts and great records are becoming mutually exclusive ideals for aspiring artists, Metz prove that, with a little patience, you can still have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/wG6Q3iGbVlY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Stuart Berman</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17170-metz/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17170-metz/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Tame Impala: Lonerism</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/abLCtIKVEjQ/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If their debut was any indication, &lt;a href="http://www.tameimpala.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tame Impala&lt;/a&gt;'s second full-length, &lt;i&gt;Lonerism&lt;/i&gt;, will once again be compared to albums from the late 1960s and early 70s. But if their intent was to make a record that &lt;i&gt;sounds &lt;/i&gt;like it came from that era, they've failed and ended up with something more fascinating. Sure, there's merit to the countless groups and scenes that seek out the right tube amps and compressors and microphones in order to create flawless period pieces. They're often called "revivalists," even though the actual term is wasted on them. Are they really breathing &lt;i&gt;new &lt;/i&gt;life into this form by keeping it cryogenically frozen in ideas nearly a half-century old? Tame Impala prove far more exciting because, by maximizing the use of the available technology, they tap into the progressive and experimental spirit of psychedelic rock, and not just the sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tame Impala did something similar on 2010's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Innerspeaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they might be open to "Same Impala"-type jokes if the expanse of psychedelic rock were something you'd be expected to move on from after one record. &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;does make the kind of tune-ups that typically generate a lot of second LP plaudits: It's leaner, more propulsive, more confident, and less beholden to its influences. But &lt;i&gt;Lonerism&lt;/i&gt;'s genius manifests itself in Tame Impala's ability to figure out a way to integrate the concepts of electronic music-making without resorting to ripping off the breakbeat/Beatles template of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5NX1FC-7-w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Setting Sun"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leader Kevin Parker doesn't &lt;i&gt;sound&lt;/i&gt; like an electronic producer, he just thinks like one. He sees his songs as blank canvases rather than boxed-in verse/chorus structures while emphasizing fluidity, constant motion, and textural evolution. You could spend the entirety of opener "Be Above It" letting your ears luxuriate in the diversity of tactile sensations-- the subliminal whisper of the title becomes a rhythm track, a barreling drum break is severely tweaked to sound like an oncoming rush of bison, a flanged guitar wobbles like neon Jello, and Parker's laconic, slightly echoed vocals pulls the whole thing together. &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;could go anywhere from that point, which is confirmed by the majestic song that follows, "Endors Toi". Follow the regal path of the lead synth or tilt your ears towards the righteously loud drum rolls that sound like masterfully chopped Bonham/Moon samples. I'm reminded of Radiohead's stated goal on "Airbag", which was to recreate &lt;i&gt;Endtroducing..... &lt;/i&gt;in real time, or what DJ Shadow himself has been trying to do ever since in terms of merging the rarest vinyl grooves with your stony older brother's record collection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those are the first two songs on &lt;i&gt;Lonerism&lt;/i&gt;, and it's bold to lead off with seven minutes of mostly instrumentals. Yet for all of the sonic trickery, Tame Impala are anchored by the righteous aspects of classic rock. They're throwbacks in the sense that they operate from a pre-punk perspective where each musician has the chops and confidence to be capable of soloing, and the singer and the drummer were cranked loud as hell. Yes, Parker does sound like John Lennon. Many athletes pattern their golf swings after Tiger Woods, their batting stance on Barry Bonds, or stick out their tongue while taking a jump shot like Michael Jordan. It means little if you don't have the skills to connect and perform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More important is how Parker writes melodies that are instantly memorable, that rise and fall with beautiful simplicity and give what are fairly basic and relatable sentiments heft. &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;lacks a chorus that instantly pops like "Solitude Is Bliss", which is an issue only if you think the best melodies necessarily need to appear in the middle of the song. You'd be hard-pressed to find hooks as catchy as the &lt;i&gt;verses &lt;/i&gt;during the run that spans "Music to Walk Home By" through &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13939-elephant/" target="_blank"&gt;"Elephant"&lt;/a&gt;, and while none initially stands out as the kind of hit that might push Tame Impala to bigger festival stages, the cumulative effect means &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;might.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the above is all well and good for the people who might use &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;to EQ their hi-fis. Does it make you feel anything? On &lt;i&gt;Innerspeaker&lt;/i&gt;, Parker sang, "You will never come close to how I feel," so what's the emotional component to &lt;i&gt;Lonerism? &lt;/i&gt;Though Parker's lyrics are plainspoken and occasionally a little elusive, Tame Impala's two records are called &lt;i&gt;Innerspeaker &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Lonerism, &lt;/i&gt;some of their songs go by titles like "Solitude Is Bliss", "Why Won't They Talk to Me?", "Island Walking", and "Mind Mischief". You get the idea of where Parker's head is at, or more to the point, that Parker's head is where &lt;i&gt;he's &lt;/i&gt;at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's a fairly common concern in this realm. You think about most of the technophile, prog-rock opuses of recent decades and most sound like spiritual heirs of King Crimson, Pink Floyd, or Black Sabbath; records like &lt;i&gt;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Kid A&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt; The Moon &amp;amp; Antarctica&lt;/i&gt; tell the listener that their state of being is forced upon them, by shadowy governments, by heartless technology, by an uncaring god. It justifies the headphones-bound quarantine.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;What distinguishes Tame Impala is how they are able to explore the emotional difference between being alone and being isolated. Jayson Greene described Parker's voice vividly as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47431-report-tame-impala-live-in-brooklyn/"&gt;"like someone trapped John Lennon's vocal take from 'A Day in the Life' in a jar and taught it to sing new songs."&lt;/a&gt; In terms of a mentality, to me it's more along the lines of "I'm Only Sleeping", embodying and advocating a wakeful and passive state of psychedelia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;derives much of its philosophical and musical pleasure from this interaction of micro and macro. Tame Impala stack vocal and guitar harmonies on the loveably hungover "Mind Mischief", and then Parker and co-producer Dave Fridmann take control of the mixing consoles and shake the whole thing up like a snowglobe. A similarly fun trick happens on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13851-apocalypse-dreams/" target="_blank"&gt;"Apocalypse Dreams"&lt;/a&gt;, which builds the momentum of a bouncy Northern Soul groove up to a peak before the mix abruptly cuts off and spits them back into a panoramic, HD jam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these rich sounds serve as an alternate take on anticipating technological encroachment, that humanity and technology aren't necessarily at war. You feel small while listening to &lt;i&gt;Lonerism&lt;/i&gt;, but in a way that makes you appreciate how man, machine, and Mother Nature can harmonize. &lt;i&gt;Lonerism &lt;/i&gt;is portable and joyous in an unforced way, a soundtrack for the times when you're walking downtown and look up at a collection of skyscrapers, or driving through a mountain pass on an interstate or even looking at a Ferris wheel next to an ocean thinking, "Holy shit, &lt;i&gt;how did this all get here?&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/abLCtIKVEjQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Miguel: Kaleidoscope Dream</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/qvaq-PKeyyQ/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Since his debut in 2010 with the outstanding &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4GJVOMjCC4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Sure Thing"&lt;/a&gt;, the young Los Angeles singer/songwriter &lt;a href="http://officialmiguel.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; has been something of a for-the-R&amp;amp;B-heads-only sleeper star. He showed up armed with a guitar, an endearing croon that is both virtuosic and everyman, a coiffed haircut, and a slightly retro sensibility. His voice is an elastic thing that's rarely used to excessive effect; he avoids the histrionic R. Kelly worship of so many of his compatriots in favor of the school of smooth Sam Cooke ad-libs. And though his lyrics are full of silly puns and earnest platitudes, he takes sex very seriously: He's a happily-married man in a genre full of lascivious bachelors, and his best music radiates maturity, self-assured and confident but rarely showy. But despite his obvious talent, he hasn't quite been able to break through to a wider audience.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Miguel's 2010 debut album, &lt;i&gt;All I Want Is You&lt;/i&gt;, was flanked with some stellar singles but weighed down by a lack of identity as he flitted from producer to producer. It sounded like he couldn't decide whether he wanted to be a Salaam Remi faux-nostalgia crooner or a smart hip-hop crossover star, and the indecision hung over the record like a cloud (it didn't perform well commercially either). He returned earlier this year with a free trio of EPs under the self-conscious title of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16571-art-dealer-chic-vols-1-3/" target="_blank"&gt;Art Dealer Chic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;showing a newfound entrepreneurial sensibility and a streak of independence. Those mostly self-produced songs at times sounded like rough sketches, but they made it up for it by sounding personal and liberated from the demands of the industry. Free and widely available, they earned him some well-deserved re-examination. They also contained his best songs to date. And now, with his second full-length, he's delivered on that early promise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kaleidoscope Dream&lt;/i&gt; starts off with "Adorn", also found on the first &lt;i&gt;Art Dealer Chic&lt;/i&gt; EP. It's one of the giddiest love songs of the year, a track where ecstatic infatuation is hemmed in by Miguel's understated vocal dexterity, and this album feels like its proper context. He rockets off into falsetto for irresistibly brief moments, and a new outro spirals elegant, trained vocal gymnastics around the song's chorus. "Adorn" also showcases Miguel's secret weapon: modesty. It's definitively, deceptively simple, a nugget of concentrated sunshine, and not necessarily all that original. But I'll be damned if it doesn't pull you in and make you feel it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;That touch of modesty colors most of &lt;i&gt;Kaleidoscope Dream&lt;/i&gt;. There's the tender &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13969-use-me/" target="_blank"&gt;"Use Me"&lt;/a&gt; where he admits being nervous about having sex with the lights on. Even more affecting is the acoustic murmur "Pussy Is Mine", which deflates masculinized hip-hop tropes with insecurity, pleading, "Tell me that the pussy is mine/ 'Cause I don't wanna believe that anyone is just like me." The sentiment turns sardonic on the Ryan Leslie-like jaunt of "How Many Drinks?", where gorgeous falsetto verses are offset by uncertain pleas of "I don't wanna waste my time." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The plush, lightly psychedelic production buffers the record's more barebones moments, and Miguel's precocious vocals take flight on the bombast rather than drowning in it. Standout "Do You..." unfolds in an ethereal cloud of synth, voices streaming like angelic choirs before stumbling into a verse buoyed by its own euphoria. Not many singers could get away with lines like "What about matinee movies/ Pointless secrets/ Midnight summer swim, private beaches/ Rock, paper, scissors/ Wait! best outta three!" It's the stuff of unbearable rom-com montages, but Miguel's playful delivery brings it over. He's the rare vocalist who makes you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; what he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent. When he wants to sound deadly serious, he's on the verge of tears; when he's happy, he's practically laughing as he sings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kaleidoscope Dream&lt;/i&gt; has elements of the sort of tasteful R&amp;amp;B record that the Grammys love, but much like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/" target="_blank"&gt;Beyoncé's &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it cuts through its own statuesque stateliness with raw emotion reined in by an ever-present sense of professionalism. And it succeeds in part because it sounds like Miguel's album and no one else's. There are no intrusive guest appearances, and the record sounds even less of its time than the first, reveling in its own contextual vacuum with abandon. Though there are some unexpected choices. Like "Don't Look Back", which is propped up by grand synth runs before melting into an interpolation of the Zombies' "Time of the Season". That song's musky psychedelia is a good example of the record's overarching theme, the highly sexualized seen through the lens of the eager and innocent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;When Miguel isn't accompanied by glossy synths, the music is all about intimacy. Take "Arch &amp;amp; Point"-- with a simple rasp, strum, and metronome, it sounds like it was recorded in the very bedroom it's ostensibly taking place in. "When it feels this good then it just comes natural," he insists, and there's not a better ethos for where his career stands at this point. Emerging unscathed from middling mainstream performance, &lt;i&gt;Kaleidoscope Dream&lt;/i&gt; sounds, at its utmost, natural and easy, an artist set free to do what he wants and proving himself every bit the unique voice his debut seemed to deny. It's respectful of tradition, quietly ambitious, and deeply personal, a wonderfully considered album from an artist who was starting to seem a lot like a forgotten gem in the wake of mishandled promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/qvaq-PKeyyQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andrew Ryce</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17125-kaleidoscope-dream/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17125-kaleidoscope-dream/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Flying Lotus: Until the Quiet Comes</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/die0BotNtGU/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Steven Ellison called his breakthrough album as Flying Lotus &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;and his music still has a strong metaphorical connection to the city. He's an admirer of producers like Dr. Dre, but Ellison's vision mixes the pulse of contemporary urban life with an extra dose of sci-fi futurism. He has his ear to the ground in terms of what's happening now and what's real, but his mind is fixated on what &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; happen tomorrow-- part &lt;i&gt;Boyz n the Hood&lt;/i&gt;, part &lt;i&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/i&gt;. And since Ellison's musical palette always circles back to the Eastern-tinged textures that infiltrated jazz when his great aunt Alice Coltrane was helping set the pace (assorted bells, harp plucks, the pings of steel and knock of wood), his music feels cosmic, bound to L.A. as a geographic idea but not necessarily of this earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the last five years, Flying Lotus has become a standard-bearer for 21st-century beat construction by looking forward and backward simultaneously and making music that feels like an exploration. So what happens when such an artist reaches a cul-de-sac? After Flying Lotus' 2010 landmark &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cosmogramma&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, further density was not an option. That album was packed so tightly with rhythms, instruments, and textures that adding more to the mix would have meant risking identity; just a few more samples could have turned the music into an indistinct mush that contains every color at once. &lt;i&gt;Cosmogramma&lt;/i&gt; felt like an end game, and the new Flying Lotus album, &lt;i&gt;Until the Quiet Comes&lt;/i&gt;, finds Ellison lighting out in a new direction. He's thinking in terms of air, mood, and simplicity. In an interview with the UK magazine &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;, Ellison described Quiet as his attempt at "a children's record, a record for kids to dream to." While there's nothing cute or naive on the album, you get a sense of what Ellison might mean when it comes to dreaming.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The album's opening section, including "Until the Colours Come", "Heave(n)", and "All In", functions as a sort of miniature suite of downtempo jazz. This is Flying Lotus at its most vibe-heavy and mystical, where rooms are thick with purple incense and it's always 3 a.m. The sound is not new-- tracks like these were a cornerstone of 1990s trip-hop of the &lt;i&gt;Headz&lt;/i&gt; comp/Ninja Tune variety-- but the sheer beauty of Ellison's design sets his music apart. This is a quality he shares with the very different &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/" target="_blank"&gt;Ricardo Villalobos&lt;/a&gt;: By pulling back and giving his meticulously-constructed elements room to breathe, Ellison allows us to hear them as if for the first time. "Tiny Tortures" begins with a rhythm that's all bones-- a simulated wood block, snare, and hissy cymbal tracing out an off-kilter beat. Against this backdrop the bass guitar of Stephen "Thundercat" Bruner enters, and the contrast between his gliding, harmonically rich runs and the spare opening is breathtaking. Thundercat's expressive bass work also adds character to the comparatively thick title track, as a gong and handclaps flow continuously like water over rocks while an unstable Dilla-fied keyboard wedges in between the beats. But even here, when there's more going on, the ear can fixate on any one sound and extract feeling from it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the album progresses, it changes in feel, but the shifts are organic. If the tracks in the opening section bring to mind an abstraction of spaced-out jazz, elsewhere Ellision conjures the blocky colors of videos games. See the thick 8-bit synths in "Sultan's Request", the curlicue melody in &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47907-video-flying-lotus-putty-boy-strut/" target="_blank"&gt;"Putty Boy Strut"&lt;/a&gt;, the simple refrain of the title track, which makes me think of a digital hero on a quest. These lighter moments are careful and reserved. You can feel Ellison putting a smaller frame around each individual part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hushed world Ellison has constructed here is hermetic and internally focused, even for him, and the album's guests don't break the spell. The featured players meet Ellison on his turf and adapt to the landscape of the record. Erykah Badu's connection to Flying Lotus' broader aesthetic is readily apparent, as her sense of mystical earthiness is grounded in tradition but free to wander outside of it. On &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14068-see-thru-to-u-ft-erykah-badu/" target="_blank"&gt;"See Thru to U"&lt;/a&gt;, she does away with soul singing in its formal sense and allows herself to become an instrument. The result is a satisfying melding of creative personalities but it wouldn't work on an Erykah Badu album-- it's too vaporous, too unconcerned with personality. The same goes for Thom Yorke's contribution on "Electric Candyman"; Ellison turns him into a ghost, which makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the shattering &lt;i&gt;Cosmogramma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Until the Quiet Comes&lt;/i&gt; is disarming at first. It sometimes feels like an experiment in how much can be stripped away while still sounding like Flying Lotus, but the reduction offers a new perspective into what Ellison is about. &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cosmogramma&lt;/i&gt; brought to mind the L.A. that thrives on acceleration. The energy here is just as strong, but it's concentrated into a smaller space. So while this might be Flying Lotus' most accessible record, it's less about being pleasant and more about deep focus. Each of these 18 tracks tends to introduce one or two emotional or musical elements and meditate on them for a brief time before easing back into silence. &lt;i&gt;Quiet &lt;/i&gt;is a series of suggestions or clues and it always feels just out of reach, but that leaves a lot of room for the listener. The surface is a gorgeous invitation to return and see if you can figure out what it all means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/die0BotNtGU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mark Richardson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dum Dum Girls: End of Daze EP</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/btCy_dRShpY/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that &lt;a href="http://wearedumdumgirls.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dum Dum Girls&lt;/a&gt; thrive in short form. Though they've turned into a versatile band comfortable in an array of styles, their roots are in garage rock, a sound that has a long history of mining the potential of brevity: It's a genre built on a foundation of singles, whose holy text is aptly titled "Nuggets", and whose philosophy is summarized by a song that went "I hope I die before I get old." Though Dum Dum Girls' latest EP, &lt;i&gt;End of Daze&lt;/i&gt;, has a handful of gothic influences, its all-killer-no-filler concision feels like a tribute to the spirit that they've have been riffing on since their debut, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14054-i-will-be/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Will Be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unhurried but not a beat too long, &lt;i&gt;End of Daze &lt;/i&gt;is a confident and comprehensive showcase for everything Dum Dum Girls do well, from luxuriant, moody ballads to driving, melodic guitar pop-- and after 18 minutes, it punches the time clock like somebody who just declared checkmate: Your move, every other band trying to sound like this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time an EP has marked a turning point in the Dum Dum Girls' run. Last year's terrific, four-song &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15156-he-gets-me-high-ep/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;He Gets Me High&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; EP introduced a newfound Chrissie Hynde-like depth to Dee Dee's voice and new-car glimmer to the Girls' formerly lo-fi sound. It was a collection of cheery, upbeat songs about infatuation, except for the closing track -- a cover of the Smiths classic "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out". Bold is the band that thinks it can bring something new to the song that's launched a million mascara tears, but Dum Dum Girls pulled it off in grand style. Sandy's kick drum towered 10-stories high and Dee Dee sold the track's jet-black drama, uttering her chilling delivery of "I want to see people and I want to see life" like a member of the walking dead. Now, on &lt;i&gt;End of Daze&lt;/i&gt;, they're now penning some dark gems of their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I've dreamed a death/ It's mine tonight," Dee Dee drawls on the opener "Mine Tonight", which smolders slowly and purposefully for a minute and a half before bursting into a panoramic blaze. Like &lt;i&gt;Only in Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Daze&lt;/i&gt; is an exploration of the feelings triggered by the recent death of Dee Dee's mother. But while many of the songs on &lt;i&gt;Dreams&lt;/i&gt; painted grief with a palette of simple descriptors and easy rhymes ("There's nothing to say/ At the end of the day/ I'm wasting away"), &lt;i&gt;Daze&lt;/i&gt; expresses these emotions with more depth. Tears fall "from desert eyes," home is "a sweet prison," and both Satan and Icarus make cameo appearances. The lush, cavernous sonics produced by loyal Dum Dum Girls collaborators Richard Gottehrer and Sune Rose Wagner echo this step forward, too. Sonically and lyrically, &lt;i&gt;Daze&lt;/i&gt; does &lt;i&gt;Dreams&lt;/i&gt; one better by blowing personal sorrow up to a mythic scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From "Mine Tonight" to the wonderfully brooding cover of Scottish new wave duo's Strawberry Switchblade's "Trees and Flowers" ("I hate the trees and I hate the flowers, and I hate the buildings, the way they tower over me"), there's not a weak song in the bunch. But the last two in particular are perhaps the best Dee Dee's ever written. Dripping with conviction, longing and remorse (and set off by an instantly transfixing opening line: "I want to live a pure life"), &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13972-lord-knows/" target="_blank"&gt;"Lord Knows"&lt;/a&gt; has a melody so perfectly gratifying that you'd swear you've heard it before. And in some ways, you have; it quotes the chord progression of "Crimson and Clover", right down to the chiming riff that punctuates the end of each line in the verse. But "Lord Knows" inhabits its influences so fully and with such conviction that this familiarity only makes it that much more magnetic. It taps into the strange sorcery of the greatest rock'n'roll songs, possessed with the power to set the world in slow motion for four commanding minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Season in Hell", on the other hand, kicks earth back into its orbit. A distorted riff quivers, and then Sandy's echoey, galloping beat drives the song forward. It is a song about the moment when your grief becomes portable, the necessity of continuing to mourn but also carrying on. It's a simple, emotionally sophisticated line from a band not generally lauded for their lyrics, but, coming at the end of a smartly sequenced narrative about darkness and redemption, its conclusion is that much more affecting: "Doesn't dawn look divine?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Garage rock is also a genre of quick burnouts, its best compilations scattered with one- or no-hit wonders whose most explosive fireworks burned bright for three minutes before vanishing altogether. So perhaps the most profound way that the Dum Dum Girls have transcended their influences is the simple fact that they've stuck around, pushed past their limits, and gotten that much better. &lt;i&gt;End of Daze&lt;/i&gt; is their best release. Much more than a stop-gap between LPs, it's succinct but irrefutable proof that this band's dynamite has a long fuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/btCy_dRShpY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lindsay Zoladz</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17084-end-of-daze-ep/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17084-end-of-daze-ep/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>How to Dress Well: Total Loss</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/OecqV5wOxdo/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Tom Krell has never been shy about naming his influences. On &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14678-love-remains/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Remains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/" target="_blank"&gt;How to Dress Well&lt;/a&gt; debut, they were pop and R&amp;amp;B acts like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11978-ready-for-the-world/" target="_blank"&gt;Ready For the World&lt;/a&gt;, Shai, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14709-ecstasy-with-jojo/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://howtodresswell.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-started-remembering-in-1989.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bobby Brown&lt;/a&gt;. He's no less forthcoming about the inspirations behind his heartbreaking second LP, &lt;i&gt;Total Loss. &lt;/i&gt;During the penultimate apologia "Set It Right", he provides a roll call: Ryan, Dan, Mama, Grandma, Francey, Robbie, Nicky, and the list goes on. None of them are famous, none are musicians. They're real people in Krell's life. Some have died (his uncle and best friend), others are living but have slipped out of view, many including himself are struggling with depression. So the title &lt;i&gt;Total Loss &lt;/i&gt;gives you fair warning about what to expect. Where &lt;i&gt;Love Remains &lt;/i&gt;drew much of its power from emotional suggestion and tactile sensation, &lt;i&gt;Total Loss &lt;/i&gt;uses the common tools of pop expression-- four-minute songs, autobiography, choruses, confession-- to create a work of poignant and devastating art.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The cruel irony of &lt;i&gt;Total Loss &lt;/i&gt;is that it finds Krell striving for directness and candor with family members who've become unavailable to him through breakups, depression, addiction, or death. The record's first lyric-- "You were there for me when I was in trouble/ You could understand for me that life was a struggle"-- is addressed to Krell's mother and reprised later on. Otherwise, the listener is in the position of the "you" populating so many of Krell's thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The sleek, alabaster sound of &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt; is a far cry from the heavily distorted and distant &lt;i&gt;Love Remains&lt;/i&gt;. That album wasn't considered a drug record for the same reasons Ambien isn't considered recreational, but its shrouded production mimicked the effect the drug can have when it starts to kick in: the sensation of controlling yourself in an out-of-body experience. That feeling is foreign to &lt;i&gt;Total Loss.&lt;/i&gt; It's still flooded with reverb, but the anesthetic is gone.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;As a result, &lt;i&gt;Total Loss &lt;/i&gt;feels subject to heightened sensitivity both sonically and lyrically, and the effect is made more unnerving by the sharp, sudden movements of its elements-- harp plucks, ticking hi-hats, slapped snares and, of course, Krell's own voice. It's high, thin, and boyish, but in no way timid. His quavering falsetto creates an intriguing friction against the newly aggressive, seething tone of his lyrics, particularly when he grapples with the self-blame, hopelessness, and betrayal that survivors of suicide victims often experience. "Say My Name or Say Whatever" begins with a recording of a homeless teen from the 1984 documentary &lt;i&gt;Streetwise&lt;/i&gt; describing the freeing effects of flight. "The only bad part about flying," he says, "is having to come back down to the fuckin' world," a projection of Krell's own idealism and disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Though it contains &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt;'s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;most visceral, even sexual music, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13905-cold-nites/" target="_blank"&gt;"Cold Nites"&lt;/a&gt; sounds downright angry. The hook boasts, "But I keep on doing it/ Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this," and it's an anger born from Krell's perception of his own shortcomings-- "Tell me what I've got to do to get better."  Album opener "When I Was in Trouble" is a piano hymn that takes its cues from William Basinski's &lt;i&gt;Disintegration Loops&lt;/i&gt;, decaying in real time. Krell moans, "Dear Mama, didn't you try to tell me everything was going to be safe?" and then repeats the line in a rare lower register. The effect is chilling, and indicative of the confusion that permeates &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt;: Whether Krell is trying to find relief in hurting himself or others is left open-ended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Fortunately, How to Dress Well's malleability prevents Krell from getting too ponderous. If you found his orchestral direction on last year's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15676-just-once-ep/" target="_blank"&gt;Just Once&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; promising, there's the string interlude of "World I Need You, Won't Be Without You (Proem)" which is reprised on the emotive centerpiece "Talking to You". &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14177-it-was-u/" target="_blank"&gt;"&amp;amp; It Was U"&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar deception, as Krell's accumulating harmonies disguise an imploding relationship over joyous new jack swing. It maybe lacks the shock of his earliest singles, and that's fine: Coming from someone discovering that his love for a style of music and his ability to pay it homage are starting to intersect, it's every bit as promising.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The rhythmic backbone of &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt;'s second half slackens a little, which can make the album feel frontloaded on the first few passes. Though &lt;i&gt;Love Remains &lt;/i&gt;was more of a compilation than a proper album, its highlights were spread out judiciously. &lt;i&gt;Total Loss &lt;/i&gt;doesn't fully compensate for its lack of clear standouts like "Decisions" or "Ready for the World", but it does benefit from a narrative cohesion that &lt;i&gt;Love Remains &lt;/i&gt;lacked. Its path of grief follows psychology's Kübler-Ross model in chronology, from denial to bargaining to something resembling acceptance-- the lyric sheet even shows a smiley-face emoticon appending the "Set It Right" line, "as far as love goes, it's one step at a time." "Struggle" revisits Krell's love for blown-out reverb, obscuring gut-punch lyrics that attempt to reconcile the joys of reckless behavior with that sort of action's deadly, consumptive attraction: "I remember drinking with you in your bed… But in the morning we'd go and start again." And while &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13650-ocean-floor-for-everything/" target="_blank"&gt;"Ocean Floor for Everything"&lt;/a&gt; wasn't a stunning first single, erring too close to melodies Krell has used before, it's an apt sendoff for &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt;, the point where the pain has settled in. But any hope here is implied. It's not explicitly a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It's a fitting conclusion to a record that is &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;lonely for Krell and risky for How to Dress Well. In light of the "PBR&amp;amp;B" digs that initially circled &lt;i&gt;Love Remains&lt;/i&gt;, it's notable that many of the most exciting artists to arrive in its wake (the Weeknd, Jessie Ware, AlunaGeorge) are nominally "indie" but incorporate modernist R&amp;amp;B in a similar manner. Krell hasn't benefited much from that swell of momentum, operating in a space that's far more niche and less overtly "pop," in both genre and populism. But &lt;i&gt;Total Loss&lt;/i&gt; is similar to the xx's &lt;i&gt;Coexist&lt;/i&gt; in retreating to further minimalism and introspection after a groundbreaking debut. It feels like more of a success because there's no dissonance between its artistic intent and its optimal home-alone listening experience. Its effectiveness is a result of its intimacy-- or, as Krell puts it on "Set It Right", being "true to you, I'm true to me, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/OecqV5wOxdo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17046-total-loss/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17046-total-loss/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Grizzly Bear: Shields</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/DJlyjzHMrFk/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"This is a foreground." That was the last lyric left hovering in the mist of Grizzly Bear's breakout 2009 album, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Veckatimest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a pretty good image to describe what it's like to listen to one of their records. The key word there is "a," signifying one of many. Whether it's the ethereal, friendly-ghost vibes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yellow House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Veckatimest's&lt;/i&gt; pristine chamber pop, Grizzly Bear create music in deep focus; what's going on in the margins of their songs is just as important and expressive as the center. Taking cues from artists like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"&gt;Talk Talk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vandykeparks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Van Dyke Parks&lt;/a&gt;, the Brooklyn four-piece make pop music with an ear for the ambient, asking us to notice the importance in detail, the beauty of texture, and the foregrounds that exist all across our spectrum of perception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there's no question that Grizzly Bear's last two records have &lt;i&gt;sounded&lt;/i&gt; gorgeous, critics of the band have wondered if that's enough. &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt;, the band's fourth and most compositionally adventurous record, should put those concerns to bed. Though full of baroque, detail-rich production and latticework melodies, &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; also offers an emotionally resonant core. The album is an excavation of loneliness, melancholy, and self-reliance. It's also a demanding record, without an instantly gratifying single like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYZbYtAl9A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11250-two-weeks/"&gt;Two Weeks&lt;/a&gt;" to hook restless ears. But the rewards that come from immersing yourself in it are odd and profound. &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; feels like a summation of Grizzly Bear's strengths, drawing a line from the muddy, minor key sonic palette of Ed Droste's home-recorded &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3666-horn-of-plenty/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Horn of Plenty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and stringing it to the heels of boundless ambition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt;' spectacular opener, "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13710-sleeping-ute/"&gt;Sleeping Ute&lt;/a&gt;", is the lone track retained from an &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8856-grizzly-bear/"&gt;aborted early session&lt;/a&gt; in Marfa, Tex., and it feels like a continuation down the path Daniel Rossen ambled on his 2012 solo EP, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16394-daniel-rossen-silent-hourgolden-mile-ep/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Silent Hour/Golden Mile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which sought solace from a busy life in the elements. "If I could be still as that gray hill," Rossen pines, before giving into an admission of humanness: "But I can't help myself." Chris Bear's drum rolls emulate thunder while chords crest with the rhythm of waves. "Sleeping Ute" moves so evocatively and theatrically like water that it sounds like a big-budget radio play of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as grandiose as it often gets, "Ute", like &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; itself, always retains a certain intimacy. These are dark and anxious waters, the choppy and tumultuous movement of the sea inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grizzly Bear have acquired a reputation for politeness; maybe it was the bow ties, maybe it was the passive-aggressive inflection of their most famous lyrics ("Would you always? Maybe sometimes? Make it easy?"), maybe it was just that &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11483-while-you-wait-for-the-others-ft-michael-mcdonald/"&gt;Michael McDonald collaboration&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; serves as a visceral reminder of how unsettled and uncanny Grizzly Bear's music often feels. (Remember that superbly creepy &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjecYugTbIQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; for "Two Weeks," full of smiles pulled tight enough to induce nightmares?) The pair of lead-off singles, "Sleeping Ute" and "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13989-yet-again/"&gt;Yet Again&lt;/a&gt;", each find a way of transcending the tension of "putting on appearances," one of Grizzly Bear's favorite themes. The lyrics of the Droste-led "Yet Again" detail repression and repose ("Take it all in stride/ Speak, don't confide"), which makes the payoff-- a final minute of instrumental fury lead by the torrent of Chris Bear's percussion and the squiggling lightning strikes of Rossen's guitar-- that much more cathartic. Dynamic shifts like this give the record an air of uncertainty that contrasts with the sheer beauty of the arrangements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grizzly Bear is a democracy. They stand in a horizontal row on stage, and you get this sense of intra-band egalitarianism from their records, too. By now, each of the four members has cultivated his own unique and expressive vocabulary, and each feels integral to the sound of &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt;. Chris Bear's drumming is lyrical and swift, moving from delicately timed details to big, booming ruckuses (check out the way his percussive rumbles in the background of the verses of "Yet Again" foreshadow its avalanche of a conclusion), while Chris Taylor's penchant for haunting effects and gently buoyant grooves adds an otherworldly weightlessness to these soundscapes. Droste's voice resounds with ache and longing, and there's a newfound and welcome gravel to his vocals that add a raw, unvarnished quality to songs like "The Hunt" and "Speaking in Rounds".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; showcases Rossen's growth most of all. The songs that sounded distinctly his on &lt;i&gt;Yellow House&lt;/i&gt;-- "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POCV842BFo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Little Brother&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwP2R1YEjzg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;On a Neck, On a Spit&lt;/a&gt;" in particular-- were grounded in a familiar folk sound. But from the rollicking strums that propel "Speaking in Rounds" to the creaking, rusted textures he teases out of "The Hunt", Rossen's playing on &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt; is a seamless blend of folksy textures, jazzy fluidity, and proggy imagination that feels downright inimitable. &lt;a href="http://jonimitchell.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; has called her own idiosyncratic tunings as "chords of inquiry," and this feels like an apt term for the tones and inflections that Rossen conjures too. They're stirring precisely because they're unresolved: the progression that ends "Speaking in Rounds"' chorus, for example, chirps like a series of unanswered questions, each one a little more urgent and insoluble than the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that's a great part of Shields' emotional pull: The album reverberates with a sense of irresolution. This was present before with Grizzly Bear-- &lt;i&gt;Yellow House&lt;/i&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLaI1EyfitU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;" concludes with a fireworks display of unanswered pleas: "What now? What now? What now?"-- but never to such a degree. And it's that tension that makes returning to &lt;i&gt;Shields &lt;/i&gt;so rewarding. The final one-two punch is a stunner, where the poignant grace of "Half-Gate" gives way to the magnificently epic "Sun in Your Eyes". If "Sleeping Ute" was the start of a sojourn from society, "Sun" ends not with a return but a transcendent kiss-off: "So long, I'm never coming back."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This closing pair of songs speaks to the album's complexity. Despite the formalism and easy-to-love production, &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt;' best moments inflict a sense of unease that wriggles under the skin and lingers after the final crescendo. But this collection of unvarnished shipwreck-spirituals is after something more challenging than a feel-good ending. With &lt;i&gt;Shields&lt;/i&gt;, Grizzly Bear make certain demands--hold still, listen closely-- that seem downright radical in a busy and impatient world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/DJlyjzHMrFk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lindsay Zoladz</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17037-shields/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17037-shields/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Wild Nothing: Nocturne</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/RTXeM_jDpeA/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"You want to know me? Well, what's to know?" asks Jack Tatum on the title track of Wild Nothing's &lt;i&gt;Nocturne&lt;/i&gt;. The album's subtly addictive nature is such that only after a dozen listens did this anti-revelation strike me as its most revealing lyric. Tatum really does view himself as a facilitator. He drove that point home during &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8902-wild-nothing/"&gt;our interview&lt;/a&gt; last month, debunking any attempts made in the past two years to classify him as a "personality." This seems self-defeating for a guy who works in a style of lovelorn, Anglophilic indie rock that never goes &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;style because it never really goes out of style, and tends to favor extreme recluses or extroverts for its breakout artists. Fortunately, &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;distinguishes itself from the perrennial crowd of dream-pop nostalgists for the same reason Wild Nothing's 2010 debut &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini/" target="_blank"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; did: Tatum is simply one of the best songwriters in this field, and &lt;i&gt;Nocturne&lt;/i&gt;'s significant upgrade in fidelity&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;makes that point more clearly than ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it's better than &lt;i&gt;Gemini &lt;/i&gt;or its EP follow-up, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14937-golden-haze-ep/" target="_blank"&gt;Golden Haze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;only matters in the event you have room for just one Wild Nothing album in your life, and you probably shouldn't limit yourself. It's hard to imagine anyone who dug &lt;i&gt;Gemini &lt;/i&gt;jumping ship here-- &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;is a richer, comparatively luxurious listening experience, but it doesn't sound flashy or ostentatious. Even while recording with one of Brooklyn's classiest sonic interior decorators in Nicolas Vernhes, Tatum granted himself only basic amenities-- live strings, a human drummer, better microphones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;is painted with the same colors as &lt;i&gt;Gemini&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;but the resolution is much higher. When the songs on &lt;i&gt;Gemini &lt;/i&gt;wanted to convey vitality or physicality, they were charmingly ramshackle, stuffed with busy drum machines and insistently strummed guitar. If &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;wants for anything, it's the sense of immediacy that marked highlights such as "Chinatown" and "Summer Holiday". This record is more about craftsmanship. Lead singles &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13760-shadow/" target="_blank"&gt;"Shadow"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14002-paradise/" target="_blank"&gt;"Paradise"&lt;/a&gt; feel newly urgent in a holistic way, going places Tatum couldn't access in his Blacksburg dorm room two years ago. "Shadow" allows itself brief asides between verses to let those lustrous strings moan and swoon, "Paradise" interrupts its glistening downer-disco for an indulgent ambient build-up. The full-bodied sound means the softer side of &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;gets fleshier too. &lt;i&gt;Gemini &lt;/i&gt;relied on reverb to convey texture and depth, and while there's still plenty on "Through the Grass", the rhythmic complexity of the song's delicate, interwoven arrangement plays a bigger role in making it one of the loveliest thing to be done with guitars this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Entire labels and local scenes are dedicated to preserving the era &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;evokes-- lacquering the malaised vocals, getting the right reverb plates, and hoping that aesthetic identification is more important than writing melodies that stick. Tatum, however, is a songwriter first who just happens to work in this medium. His vocals are put to the forefront to give the listener a clearly marked place to return, and his melodies are smoothly curved, like a small divot at which the rest of the arrangements can dig deeper. The hopscotch verse melody of "Shadow" works in tandem with an insistent, four-note motif doubled on lead guitar and violin. On "Counting Days", a simonized harmony serves as the chorus, but the little guitar countermelody that darts around it is the hook. Tatum understands the semantics of this stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Which makes it strange that his ambitions as a melodic tunesmith aren't matched by his lyrics. Successfully writing like Robert Smith can be just as tricky as doing a decent Morrissey, which becomes clear every time &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;crosses an invisible line where a tiny bit of editing would pay off: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14002-paradise/" target="_blank"&gt;"Paradise"&lt;/a&gt; contains the sensible-sounding, yet bafflingly mixed metaphor "velvet tongue so sweet", while "Only Heather" rhymes first and asks questions later: "I couldn't explain it/ I won't even try/ She is so lovely she makes me feel high."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Or maybe that's the only kind of lyric that really matters on &lt;i&gt;Nocturne. &lt;/i&gt;If there's a Heather in your life, that song might be the centerpiece of your next mix. Or you might just listen to it hoping you'll meet a Heather, in which case, Wild Nothing is invested in the concept of wish fulfillment. This is called &lt;i&gt;dream-&lt;/i&gt;pop for a reason, and there's no logic for what drives adults to lie out on the grass staring at the sun for hours or write songs about girls with fantastical names like "Rheya". &lt;i&gt;Nocturne &lt;/i&gt;gives a voice to those feelings, and damn if it isn't lovely to listen to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/RTXeM_jDpeA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Swans: The Seer</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/s7l_Id7GP0M/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://swans.pair.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Swans&lt;/a&gt; are a band that conjure primal forms of power: thunder and lightning, fire and brimstone, master over slave, predator over prey. Their earliest albums came out in the wake of New York's no wave scene, a loose, radical contest to see who could make rock'n'roll sound as ugly as possible while still retaining the rhythms and forms that made it rock'n'roll. Swans, not central to the scene, countered with the possibility of wiping out rock altogether. The result was something that sounds sort of like monks chanting in front of a jet engine. Frontman Michael Gira once compared being in the band to "trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget taunting you"-- a description that could just as easily describe listening to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the late 1980s and early 90s, Swans went through a goth phase, incorporating sparkly synths, reverb, acoustic guitars, and other signposts of what most people would call "music." But whenever things felt too comfortable, Gira would flatly drop lines like, "You never say you know me when I'm inside you," or, "I'm so glad I'm better than you are." Beauty and ugliness have never been as relevant to their music as the possibility of turning music into a space of confrontation. In the parlance of reality television, Swans aren't-- and never have been-- here to make friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a nearly 15-year break during which Gira focused on the dark Americana project Angels of Light, Swans reformed. Since then, they've released two albums, one studio (2010's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and one live (2012's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16588-we-rose-from-your-bed-with-the-sun-in-our-head/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). "[The reunion] is not repeating the past," Gira said in 2010. He is currently 58 years old and often photographed in a cowboy hat, not smiling. At two hours, &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; is among the group's longest studio albums and, in a sweeping gesture that only the most confident and egocentric artists can pull off, it manages to expand on their sound while simultaneously summarizing everything they've ever recorded before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The band's current palette includes a whole trunkload of acoustic instruments: bells, accordion, clarinet, dulcimer, a chorus of bagpipes, and what's referred to cryptically as "handmade violin thing." With the exception of some amplifier distortion, the album puts incredible emphasis on the human body's capacity to beat the shit out of an instrument in a far more satisfying way than machines ever could. (As an instructive gesture, Gira spends the first four-and-a-half minutes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14058-mother-of-the-world/" target="_blank"&gt;"Mother of the World"&lt;/a&gt; panting in rhythm.) Noise has never been as much of a concern in Swans' music as pure dissonance; of the way certain combinations of notes literally cause the air to vibrate more violently than others. At its most chaotic, like the climax of "The Seer", the band doesn't just sound aggressive, it sounds like it's bursting apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tracks on &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; aren't songs but incantations, riffs piled on riffs shifting and evolving for as long as half an hour at a time. Sometimes Gira sings; often, there's a zombie-like chorus behind him. One section fades into the next in ways more reminiscent of a soundtrack than an album, and even relatively contained tracks like "Lunacy" start and end with winding, immersive passages as the band comes to a boil. Like airplanes, Swans take their taxiing and descent as seriously as their flight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stylistically, the album draws a jagged line through a universe of serious, apocalyptic music, from country blues to free jazz to drone and the brutal, hypnotic guitar rock Glenn Branca and Sonic Youth made while Gira was still moaning into the void. A big group of guests are important here. Former Swan Jarboe contributes, as do Karen O, and Ben Frost on my personal favorite credit, "fire sounds (acoustic and synthetic)." The bigger the group, the more familial the feeling and the more heightened the illusion is that the music is not coming from inside its players but existing, like a spirit, somewhere outside and between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the same way it would be hard to get the full experience of a good movie by only watching half of it, &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; demands its two hours. To paraphrase something the author Ben Marcus said in a trenchant &lt;a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2005/10/0080775" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with Jonathan Franzen about the value of experimental fiction, it is not a record for someone deciding whether or not they'd rather be listening to music or playing paintball. Of course this doesn't mean you need to peel off your own skin while listening to enjoy it. It has made my experience of cleaning the house, for example, feel very, very consequential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At each step of Swans' career, they've been somehow tied to whatever "dark" genre was most culturally prominent, but &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; affirms what they really are and what their legacy will probably be: A psychedelic band that rejects the musical template of psychedelia the 60s gave us. Vision has always been a metaphor for both political counterculture and religious mysticism. Prophets, pulling back the veil, "seeing through" things in an interest of revealing what they believe to be the raw, burning truth-- this is what Swans have always been about, and what &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; seems more explicitly occupied with than anything they've ever done before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gira had come out of art school, and even Swans' most mature sounding music is rooted in the kind of catharsis through self-negation that was at the conceptual heart of 70s performance and body art. One piece from his student days involved him being blindfolded and led naked into a roomful of strangers with a tape player strapped to his body, playing a prerecorded confession of his sexual desires. The piece's coordinators had found women willing to do the same. The crux of the piece was Gira and the stranger crawling around in the room until they found each other, at which point, they'd have sex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the world of Swans, the pain of catharsis is always in service of elevating to some higher plane of being. Granted, most people probably prefer to find this in exercise and not public sex, but when sifting through Swans' apparent bleakness, it's important to recognize that their goals are and always have been to remind us of the ways extreme states of being, however intense, a unique kind of blessing. One of their live albums was called &lt;i&gt;Feel Good Now&lt;/i&gt;, which is as succinct a self-summary as any artist could offer: Later, Swans bluntly suggest, you'll be dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is this music primal? Yes. Intense? Absurdly so. On "A Piece of the Sky", Gira sings that "the sun fucks the dawn." Why the sun can't just come out normally is unclear. But there's still room for music like this, music that claws its way unapologetically toward wherever it thinks answers might be hiding. After all, without Icarus and his wings, we might never know how high the sky went or how hot the sun got. For 30 years Swans have challenged the boundaries between beauty and ugliness, music and noise, catharsis and abuse. To borrow a verb from their own violent, polarized world, &lt;i&gt;The Seer&lt;/i&gt; is the album that transcends them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/s7l_Id7GP0M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mike Powell</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti: Mature Themes</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/nzVaqTTd3_o/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Ariel Pink's music began its strange journey early in the last decade, as a CD-R lying on the floor of Animal Collective's tour van. Before then, he'd been heard by almost no one, despite that he'd recorded hundreds of songs, by himself, in what sounded like a windowless dungeon. The quality of those early recordings was poor, but something shone from the murk: Pink became the first artist signed to the band's &lt;a href="http://www.paw-tracks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Paw Tracks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;label, which reissued his album&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6553-the-doldrums/" target="_blank"&gt;The Doldrums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;in 2004. The path of his career since then has been wayward and strange, culminating in the highly professional &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14324-before-today/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2010. But there are through-lines. Whether you tuned into his world during the Paw Tracks era or after &lt;i&gt;Before Today&lt;/i&gt;'s&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11846-round-and-round/" target="_blank"&gt;"Round and Round"&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;became an indie anthem, you probably sensed an intriguing off-note lurking in the L.A. home-recording savant's music.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Pink's hands, the boundless sunshine of 1970s AM pop grows queasy, even malevolent, splitting the difference between a grimace, a smirk, and a smile. Even at its loveliest, his music radiates a mesmerizing sense of bad faith: Pink often incorporates humor into his songs, but it's hard to be sure if you're in on the joke. He may express seemingly sincere sentiments in one moment while mocking them in the next. In his most compelling material, these impulses curl around each other until his "fuck you's" sound like "I love you", and vice versa.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before Today&lt;/i&gt; was Ariel Pink's breakout record, a leap to a new stage from his cult beginnings that made his skill as a songwriter and craftsman clear. Free of the lo-fi grit that characterized his Paw Tracks material, you could suddenly hear his uncanny knack for fusing together unlikely parts with no visible seams. &lt;i&gt;Mature Themes&lt;/i&gt;, Pink's grittier, gristlier, and funnier follow-up, clarifies that &lt;i&gt;Before Today&lt;/i&gt; was not a sign of things to come but rather just a signpost along his unknowable path. The production has hardened, as if Pink has found a midpoint between the warped, warbly sound of his tape releases and what he can now afford. The songs themselves, while still catchy, are often opaque, antisocial, and confounding. The mood of the record veers closer to the melted emotional nowhere of &lt;i&gt;The Doldrums&lt;/i&gt;' "Good Kids Make Bad Grown Ups" or the arch piss-take of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Worn Copy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s "Artifact".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, some have pegged &lt;i&gt;Mature Themes&lt;/i&gt; as an alienating move meant to prune Pink's flock back down to the diehards. But the album is too rich for that straightforward reading. Here, even his puerile sentiments remain generously melodic and lovingly wrought. "I'm not real and I won't call you," he croons on the title track, over a melody that climbs upward so gracefully it sounds like he's vandalizing a Shaker hymn. It might be one of the truest lines he's ever sung. But the Elvis Costello-like rising-action of the chorus, which takes the phrase "I wanted to be good" up the scale, is an expression of love, pure and simple.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Only in My Dreams" is another example of his singular songwriting mind: Listen casually and it's a Byrdsian pop tune, but sit down at a piano to map out it's details, and you'll lean back, baffled. If taken apart, no one but Pink would be able to reassemble it. It's this talent that links Pink to past practicioners of&amp;#160;outsider music-- &lt;a href="http://www.rsteviemoore.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;R. Stevie Moore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.zappa.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ween.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ween&lt;/a&gt;. Like those artists, Pink looked at the puzzle pieces of a pop song and figured out jarring new ways they fit together, mingling affection with ironic commentary and intellectual distance.&amp;#160;"Kinski Assassin" opens with Pink singing nonsense in a stentorian voice not far from a 1930s radio drama: "Suicide dumplings dropping testicle bombs." Then, he chimes in with something silky and romantic: "We'll always have Paris." The lyrics don't make any more sense together than the music behind them does, but they glide smoothly into each other, conveying a strong sense of internal coherence. It's the kind of bewitching almost-logic that drives people to endlessly re-watch David Lynch's&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460829/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inland Empire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But don't look to Pink's lyrics for clues, because they offer few ways to emotionally engage. "The bad breath of a cross-eyed goat/ Eating children for a Monday morning," go the opening lines of "Driftwood", intoned with the seriousness of a Druid. On "Symphony of the Nymph", he speak-sings the song's title in an exaggerated scientist voice straight out of &lt;a href="http://www.thomasdolby.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thomas Dolby&lt;/a&gt;'s catalogue over a backing track located somewhere between "Monster Mash" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6V2oCX3Hn4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Werewolf Bar Mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;". On "Farewell American Primitive", the sentiment that comes through most clearly is, "Fuck it." It's moments like these that forcefully remind you: There's nothing operatic at stake in Pink's music. It's a Chinese finger trap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-11/music/ariel-pink-gives-us-the-creeps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interviewed Pink in 2010, he suggested that he'd lost the ability to make music the way he did in his earlier, more prolific days. But &lt;i&gt;Mature Themes&lt;/i&gt; is as vital as anything he's ever recorded: Even the throwaway "Schnitzel Boogie" fails at being one-dimensional, playing instead like something McCartney might have worked on for the fifth side of the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/" target="_blank"&gt;White Album&lt;/a&gt;. This seesaw between sincerity and insincerity is the fuel that drives Pink's music. It's the riddle that creates his cult, and it's the reason everyone will continue to pay attention to him, no matter how many faces he pulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/nzVaqTTd3_o" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jayson Greene</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16936-mature-themes/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16936-mature-themes/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Jessie Ware: Devotion</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/L0Pxkvbbgu4/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;To begin to understand where &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jessiewaremusic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Ware&lt;/a&gt; is coming from, &lt;a href="http://www.blackcabsessions.com/index.php?id=1342089164" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;let's look at her&lt;/a&gt; stuck between an acoustic guitarist and an MPC beat pusher in the back of a London taxi. As part of the simple, self-explanatory "Black Cab Sessions" web series, the 27-year-old British singer recently took her place in the middle seat and proceeded to offer a nuanced live take on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13769-wildest-moments/" target="_blank"&gt;"Wildest Moments"&lt;/a&gt;, a slyly epic ballad from her debut album, &lt;i&gt;Devotion&lt;/i&gt;. In such tight quarters, she's not quite sure where to look-- at her bandmates, outside to the street, or directly into the camera-- her head on a controlled swivel. She's capable of blasting the back window out with her voice, which consistently strikes blue notes somewhere between Sade and Whitney, but she holds back, well-aware of her unplugged environment. The performance is seriously moving, and yet Ware lets loose a few brief grins and a slight laugh, as if to say, "All this is quite ridiculous, don't you think?" And that's Jessie Ware: a devout realist making the most of her pop-star dreams-- and her commitment to both sides of that equation turns &lt;i&gt;Devotion&lt;/i&gt; into a uniquely soulful masterclass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you've half-slept through just one episode of a reality-television singing competition over the last decade, you're probably somewhat privy to Ware's trajectory. The one-time theater kid started out as a backup singer before nearly giving up her musical aspirations to be a journalist. But then, thanks to a montage-ready twist of fate, she ended up singing lead on melodic bass producer SBTRKT's 2010 single &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je6_VPA6X-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Nervous"&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a solo label deal, which led to Ware being forced to take the spotlight. But oftentimes backup singers are off to the side for a reason, and the hard truth is that's where they will be most productive; there are only so many lead roles in the world of pop. Considering her self-described "boringly sensible" outlook and the doubt pinging around her brain ("I had to get past the idea of, like, 'Who gives a shit about what I'm gonna fucking write a song about?'"), Ware sounds more like a supporting player on paper. But then you hear her voice, and any and all limits start to fade into the distance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Singing over futuristic electronic tracks like "Nervous" and dubstep producer Joker's &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12578-the-vision-let-me-breathe-ft-jessie-ware-and-freddie-gibbs/" target="_blank"&gt;"The Vision"&lt;/a&gt;, Ware sounded strong, but also somewhat overshadowed by the showy bleeps scurrying around her. &lt;i&gt;Devotion&lt;/i&gt;, however, marries her natural gift with throbbing instrumentation that breathes life into every single turn of phrase or sensitive vocal embellishment. The tempos bounce lightly, the drama escalates, the synth-laden ambience cascades like so many postcard waterfalls. This is smoldering music, its smoke bewitching enough to make the original fire more or less irrelevant.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The record was largely produced by three men-- Dave Okumu of UK art rockers &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27748-the-invisible/" target="_blank"&gt;the Invisible&lt;/a&gt;, Bristol electronic upstart &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/" target="_blank"&gt;Julio Bashmore&lt;/a&gt;, and singer-songwriter Kid Harpoon, who co-wrote songs on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/" target="_blank"&gt;Florence and the Machine's &lt;i&gt;Ceremonials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-- each leaving his distinct mark without distracting from the whole. Okumu's tracks, especially opener "Devotion", are dark and dense, hinting at passion's underbelly with each deep bass hit; Bashmore's are more airy and upbeat, primed for classy dancefloors worldwide; Kid Harpoon offers the most festival-ready songs-- big hooks, bigger drums-- like "Wildest Moments". Tying the disparate sounds together are Okumu, who co-produced and played many instruments on nearly every track, and of course Ware herself, who co-wrote all but one song. Her voice is a marvel throughout, often gaining power by holding back or briefly teasing its scope while staying faithful to melody over melisma. Her words are in tune with this refinement as they chronicle the in-betweenness of love, dismissing easy pleasures for feelings that are more hard-won, confusing, and frightening.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take the most classically "pop" song here: the weightless &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14027-sweet-talk/" target="_blank"&gt;"Sweet Talk"&lt;/a&gt;, which modernizes Whitney Houston's late-80s effervescence &amp;#224;&amp;#160;la Beyonc&amp;#233;'s &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/Ob7vObnFUJc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Love on Top"&lt;/a&gt;. On its face, the track is all endless dimples and mesmerizing lips, but then the verses sink in: "Don't keep me with the kisses, there's never any there when I need," pleads Ware. She knows she's going to fall for the smooth nothings once again, though, and lets the keys try to cover the inevitable regret, which plays out on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1837-running/" target="_blank"&gt;"Running"&lt;/a&gt;, where Ware starts, "Your words alone could drive me to a thousand tears." The title track, with its foreboding murk, gives whiffs of a seance as Ware asks, "Ready to love but do you want it enough?/ Can we find a way to bring it back again?" Given the track's perfectly rendered storm clouds, you get the impression she already knows the answers. The idea of running comes up often on &lt;i&gt;Devotion&lt;/i&gt;, and it's clear that Ware isn't interested in the sprints-- when it comes to love, she's angling for a marathon. And she knows marathons can be really fucking tough.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about her childhood aspirations earlier this year, Ware told me, "It's so unattainable to be a singer. I'd watch 'Top of the Pops' and think I could never do that. And I didn't look like a pop star compared to the people I used to watch on MTV like J.Lo or Destiny's Child." As a middle-class Jewish girl from South London who's closer to 30 than 20, she's still nothing close to a cookie-cutter R&amp;amp;B breakout. Her success thus far-- and its likely continuation thanks to &lt;i&gt;Devotion&lt;/i&gt;-- is a testament to both her talent and budding songwriting skills, as well as the wide-open field that is modern R&amp;amp;B, where a sensitive soul like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Ocean&lt;/a&gt; can make a star-in-a-box like Chris Brown look about as relevant as a dial-up modem. "I'm just having fun and trying to pretend I'm a pop star," said Ware, talking about her high-style videos. And while embellishment and theatricality is still a coveted and worthwhile pursuit within the pop realm, the beautiful thing is that, in 2012, Jessie Ware doesn't need to pretend more than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/L0Pxkvbbgu4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ryan Dombal</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16938-devotion/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16938-devotion/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>TNGHT: TNGHT EP</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/BQvk9v8S1r8/</link><description>&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Lunice and Hudson Mowhawke of TNGHT emerged this year with a glass-shattering &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/45810-sxsw-tnght-hudson-mohawke-and-lunice/" target="_blank"&gt;SXSW set&lt;/a&gt; and a few brash, colorful bangers on Rustie's scene-defining &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16498-essential-mix/" target="_blank"&gt;BBC Essential Mix&lt;/a&gt;. While their contemporaries experiment with footwork loops, yacht rock, and 1970s prog, TNGHT zero in on rap's fixation on the loud and chaotic. Hip-hop production has always had time for bass and bombast but a growing number of producers-- notably Lex Luger, the often copied but rarely equalled soundbomber behind Waka's influential &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flockaveli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-- have an almost nihilistic embrace of sonic overkill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;TNGHT may not come from the American rap scene (Lunice is in Montreal, while HudMo's Ross Birchard is based in Glasgow), but their connection to it is clear. Lunice and Birchard have great ears for what's what and who's making it: their engaging and well-curated &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47186-tnght-new-track-higher-ground-waka-flocka-flame-remix-guest-mix-for-diplos-bbc-show/" target="_blank"&gt;hour-long mix&lt;/a&gt; for Diplo's BBC show ranged from the mush-mouthed grit of Florida's Spaceghostpurrp to Chicago's recent wave of teenage antagonism (Chief Keef, Sasha Go Hard) without showing any signs of dilettantism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Their self-titled debut EP for Warp and LuckyMe spans 16 minutes of some of the year's most brazen, positively huge hip-hop sounds. Birchard recently &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8868-tnght/" target="_blank"&gt;copped&lt;/a&gt; to Pitchfork that inspiration usually hits him when he's on the couch, but this is no DIY laptop affair: HudMo and Lunice took to a high-end London studio to bang out these five cuts, and the results sound properly expensive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Ironically, they arrived at this point by process of subtraction. Where something like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13260-jump-out/" target="_blank"&gt;Gunplay's "Jump Out"&lt;/a&gt; crams well over a hundred SFX triggers into its short runtime, creating the kind of sonic swarm that threatens to swallow itself, TNGHT's take on post-Luger smash-and-bash drama is clean and precise. The simplicity is deceptive next to the record's volume, and its minimalist approach, rounding off every seismic charge with a futuristic crispness that recalls Timbaland's game-changing creative peak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Another revelation dropped in that TNGHT interview is that there are yet-to-be-named MCs locked to spit over every single track on this EP some time in the future. It's a promising development, considering that their remix of Waka's recent single "Rooster in My Rari", which pulls off the four-leaf-clover achievement of actually making a Flocka single &lt;i&gt;louder&lt;/i&gt;-- proves that Lunice and HudMo's wordless bombs retain their effectiveness with rappers on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;On their own, though, a keen sense of structure lifts &lt;i&gt;TNGHT&lt;/i&gt;'s productions above purely functional beat-tape grooves. The breadth of carnage on the EP's centerpiece, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13891-higher-ground/" target="_blank"&gt;"Higher Ground"&lt;/a&gt;, starts with looped handclaps and vocal samples and quickly ascends to martial-law status as a synthesized tuba pops in and out to steamroll buildings just for laughs. And "Goooo"'s tight tonal coils sound like hot knives slashing through metal by its high-anxiety conclusion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;"[They] rarely work out," Birchard told us last month, regarding teaming up with others in the production world. "I've done loads of collaborations and I'm never totally happy with the outcome because it feels like you're compromising something of yourself in it." What's most impressive about TNGHT's sound, then, is how effortlessly cohesive and &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; it sounds. Those whose ears have been close to the ground over the past three years know that both HudMo and Lunice's solo work shares more than a LuckyMe affiliation-- specifically, heavy-thudded bass rhythms, splashes of synth color, and a fun-first approach to melodic phrasing indebted to dance and R&amp;amp;B alike. Separately, they compliment each other, but together, they finish each other's sentences with exclamation points in bold, underlined, 72-point type. Since the EP's completion, HudMo and Lunice have been at work on individual solo albums, but their partnership has already yielded results so impressive and of-the-moment that it's likely we haven't heard the last of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/BQvk9v8S1r8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Larry Fitzmaurice</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Purity Ring: Shrines</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/xWFuypEZq6E/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2011 a song called &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12088-ungirthed/" target="_blank"&gt;"Ungirthed"&lt;/a&gt; by a group called &lt;a href="http://thepurityring.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Purity Ring&lt;/a&gt; started circulating online. There wasn't much information about them out there; they had a member that used to be in something called Gobble Gobble, which momentarily seemed notable. But everything you needed to know was contained in the song itself. It mixed the kind of ghostly pitch-shifted vocals, reminiscent of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/" target="_blank"&gt;the Knife&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/" target="_blank"&gt;Burial&lt;/a&gt;, that had spent the previous year haunting witch house; it had warped, surging, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/" target="_parent"&gt;Dilla&lt;/a&gt;-derived synth chords that popular online remixers like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28980-star-slinger/" target="_blank"&gt;Star Slinger&lt;/a&gt; were on the verge of turning into a clich&amp;#233;. And it had the stuttering start-stop drum machine patterns that highlighted how much the pulse of Southern rap had invaded indie music the last few years. But where these production touches were often held up as ends in themselves, "Ungirthed" was a well-constructed and fully realized pop song, with an infectious vocal hook and a melody that went places. This was novel. It was the kind of tune you took notice of immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually we learned that "Ungirthed" was the work of Megan James (vocals) and Corin Roddick (production), two young musicians from Edmonton, Alberta. Wisely, they didn't rush out an album, but other songs trickled out: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12302-belispeak/" target="_blank"&gt;"Belispeak"&lt;/a&gt; surfaced in the fall and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13509-obedear/" target="_blank"&gt;"Obedear"&lt;/a&gt; emerged this spring. Along the way, Purity Ring polished up their live show, outfitting the stage with lanterns synchronized to the music, which Roddick triggered via MIDI using drumsticks. They built an audience with very little recorded music to share with it. And now, a year and a half later, they've issued their debut album, &lt;i&gt;Shrines&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since those early singles all mined such similar sounds, it was an open question how Purity Ring might mix things up over the course of an 11-song, 38-minute full-length. But&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Shrines&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;is not about range,&amp;#160;instead&amp;#160;offering subtly different versions of a single, near-perfect idea. You might think of the album as a sculpture, and each track offers a different vantage point. "Ungirthed" is how you see it head on; &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13781-fineshrine/" target="_blank"&gt;"Fineshrine"&lt;/a&gt; is what it looks like from a low angle, with a bit of shadow from the overhang providing an extra touch of darkness; "Crawlersout", with its sharper percussive edges and extra portion of ghosted vocals, is the view from 90 degrees to the left; and then "Grandloves", with unwelcome guest vocals from Isaac Emmanuel of Young Magic, is like having a guy standing between you and the work, and he won't stop talking on his cell. "Grandloves" is the one moment in which Purity Ring seem common, but that's one truly weak song out of 11. Not a bad ratio for a new band. And the consistent quality makes it easy to forgive the feeling that occasionally creeps in the first few times you hear the album straight through: "Didn't I just hear this one a couple of minutes ago?"&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quality that further elevates &lt;i&gt;Shrines&lt;/i&gt; is the lyrics, and that's something that could be easily missed, since James' vocals are often heavily processed. They, too, offer variations on a theme. "Sea water's flowing from the middle of my thighs," are the first words we here on the opening track, "Crawlersout", and the focus on the body never lets up. From "Dig holes in me with wooden carved trowels," on "Grandloves" to "The crawling animals will seek all things warm all things moist, I will relentlessly shame myself," on "Saltkin", the words are impressionistic but always come back to sweat, skin, and bones. Fluids ooze in sympathy with the chords; hearts are given away by being ripped from ribcages. The lyrics are vivid and striking, even if it takes some work to parse them out. And the contrast between their bloody earthiness and music born of 1s and 0s gives the record an appealing push/pull and provides the album with some additional staying power. These songs, so instantly catchy, have more to offer over time.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The band that Purity Ring most reminds me of is &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/" target="_blank"&gt;High Places&lt;/a&gt;. The dubbed-out retro-futuristic approach to sound, the male/female duo, the connection to the earlier iterations of indie pop, the experiments with live spectacle. And High Places also emerged more or less fully formed, with the singles and EPs collected on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11150-0307-0907/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;03/07 - 09/07&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;pulling together &lt;i&gt;au courant&lt;/i&gt; influences into something that felt personal and new. But ever since, High Places have had some difficulty figuring out where to go next. Once you own a sound and make it your own, it's not always easy to leave it behind. We'll see how that plays out with Purity Ring. For now, the compulsively listenable &lt;i&gt;Shrines&lt;/i&gt; stands quite well on its own. Most bands never manage a statement this forceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/xWFuypEZq6E" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mark Richardson</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16851-shrines/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16851-shrines/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Passion Pit: Gossamer</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/VtTJ6etmTi4/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an incomplete list of the subjects dealt with on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/" target="_blank"&gt;Passion Pit&lt;/a&gt;'s second album, &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;: immigration, alcoholism, economic disparity, suicide, mental illness, drugs, domestic abuse. So when Michael Angelakos sings, "I'm so self-loathing that it's hard for me to see," that should come across like a tremendous understatement. But two lines later, he cries "no one believes me, no not a single thing." That part cuts deep, since Passion Pit's 2009 debut LP,&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13169-manners/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Manners&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was an often dark and troubled record a lot of people chose not to take seriously due to its sugar-smacked synth pop and countless product placements. So it's no wonder that Angelakos' next words are "my brain is racing and I'll feel like I'll explode!" Three difficult years in the making, &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; is an overwhelming album about being overwhelmed, a bold and ultimately stunning torrent of maximalist musical ideas, repressed anger, and unchecked anxiety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's fitting that &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;, so focused on failure and human frailty, should begin with a stumble. "Take a Walk" is a fairly by-the-numbers Passion Pit song. Nonetheless, there's a strange imbalance to it. The massed chorus of chipper vocals and the stoic, pavement-pounding verse feel mismatched. And while Angelakos' literal account of the financial troubles facing his family is gut-wrenching and brave, it amounts to a curious fit on an album that's otherwise entirely personal. As a one-off, it would be an intriguing character study. As the leadoff track on &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;, it feels misplaced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13748-ill-be-alright/" target="_blank"&gt;"I'll Be Alright"&lt;/a&gt; doesn't allow much time for the disappointment to register. The joy-buzzer synths and Angelakos' falsetto scan as instant-gratification Passion Pit, but on both a musical and lyrical level, it's a raising of the bar, far more complex than anything the band has done to date. Consider the combination of its surging chorus and the synapse-frying barrage of microscopic jumpcuts, and you might have the weirdest and catchiest band on &lt;a href="http://warp.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Warp&lt;/a&gt;, and the most dejected if you're really paying attention. The first line of "I'll Be Alright" could be a retroactive assessment on the day-glo &lt;i&gt;Manners&lt;/i&gt;, asking "Can you remember ever having any fun?/ Cause when it's all said and done/ I always believed we were/ But now I'm not so sure." The effect is initially disorienting and uncomfortable: Do you escape into the comforts of the music or give into the lurid thrill of confrontation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angelakos is no pop subversive. While he's been &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/passion-pit/" target="_blank"&gt;forthcoming about the autobiographical details&lt;/a&gt; that inspired &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;, within the auspices of Passion Pit, he seems incapable of dealing with them through anything other than pop's pleasure principle. This was true of the now comparatively restrained &lt;i&gt;Manners&lt;/i&gt;, an album of strong melodies that worked in a fairly narrow stylistic range. On &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;, Passion Pit recast themselves as polyglots and pacesetters, tackling the currency of pop music head-on as a competitor rather than admiring it with a few well-placed press quotes. &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; is rife with dichotomy, one of which is that the hooks highest in fructose are lent to songs dealing with the most uncomfortable topic: money. While "Carried Away" proves Angelakos might not be Ezra Koenig in terms of cleverly deconstructing the interactions between the socially stratified, there's a thematic congruence in the occasionally forced rhyme within a song about saying all the wrong things. Later on, "Love Is Greed" is far more multi-layered than its title and hook ("If we really love ourselves/ How do you love somebody else?") initially indicate. Courtship is reduced to the search of "another person that's just yours for the taking," which is essentially a trenchant distillation of post-recession social science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; does have humor in its perspective, but surprisingly little joy. As the penultimate track, you might expect the rafter-reaching chorus of "It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy" to deliver some kind of relief amidst the litany of disappointments and misunderstandings, but this is a record about things not working out as expected. It leads into the disquieting calm of closer "Where We Belong", where the title is explained by a blatant suicide pact ("And then I'm lifted up/ Out of the crimson tub/ The bath begins to drain/ And from the floor he prays away all my pain"). Meanwhile, "Mirrored Sea" siphons &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/" target="_blank"&gt;M83&lt;/a&gt;'s rocket fuel and throws everything in reverse, a paralyzing descent into realizing the impossibility of escaping the lingering failures of youth ("Slipups in this town are like a sentence to life/ Like overhead insults or a cheating wife"). The overload of digital shoegaze abates for the message of a dispassionate vocoder: "everyone's alone."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If only it were that easy. Were &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; simply played out in Angelakos' head, it would probably turn out insufferably self-obsessed and tuneless like so many other "difficult" second albums. Though it doesn't make &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; a happy record, Angelakos writes with a truly affecting ability to make unflinching acknowledgments of his demons' effects on those closest to him. A substantial portion of &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; is simultaneous love letters and apologies addressed to his real-life girlfriend, and naturally they're couched within Passion Pit's most complicated arrangements to date. "You never once controlled me/ When all the others told me/ That if I kept on going I'd be dead," he sings before the platinum-plated wallop of a chorus on "Cry Like a Ghost", an admission that takes on a menacing tone as the bridge finds him awake from a blackout ("She says I screamed and that I raised my hand/ I never meant to, I wasn't even there").&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond that brief bit of violence, the love songs are desperate and very, very drunk. Were a more composed R&amp;amp;B singer given the liquid slow-jam &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13825-constant-conversations/" target="_blank"&gt;"Constant Conversations"&lt;/a&gt;, the sophistication of Angelakos' melodic transitions might overshadow a devastating verse detailing a remorseful alcoholic's account of a tired partner emptying drinks and issuing ultimatums:&amp;#160;"If there's a bump in the road, you fix it/ But for me, well I'd just run off the road/ But tonight you've got me cornered/ And I haven't got a place to go." It makes the context of "On My Way" almost unbearably intimate, Angelakos proposing, "we'll consecrate this messy love," in a voice overpowering the delicate music-box arrangement of bells and whirs with promises of a better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And is that ever a mission statement for a record of passionate reactions to a messy life. Angelakos puts so much of himself into &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; that it couldn't help but be riddled with all-too-human imperfections: Sometimes you wish he'd pick a cleverer lyric, tone down the falsetto, or at least realize that it might be in his interests to try to be cool for once. Because even though &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; could not be more overt in its exploration of profoundly adult and bleak topics, all some people might choose to hear is how most of the melodies could still sell children's cereal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We expect this sort of masculine reckoning from the likes of Matt Berninger, Britt Daniel, Bill Callahan, Hamilton Leithauser; gaunt, brooding men whose vocal austerity and general presence convey authority and wisdom. "Let's not try and figure out everything at once," &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/" target="_blank"&gt;Berninger&lt;/a&gt; sang on "Fake Empire", and it was a comforting statement from a guy who sounds like he's figured things out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt;'s music is meant to reflect its sense of encroaching panic, where you really feel like you'll explode if you don't figure out everything at once. Angelakos sings variations on "I'll be all right" and "everything will be OK" throughout, but they're not so much reassurance as commiseration. It's unclear whether you're supposed to cry on his shoulder or vice versa, but it actually makes &lt;i&gt;Gossamer&lt;/i&gt; more reassuring. Anyone can manufacture hope through a slogan, but there's an empathy and humanity that simply can't be faked as Angelakos tries to figure out how to stay atop his life. It's hard to think of a more noble goal for a pop album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/VtTJ6etmTi4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16844-gossamer/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16844-gossamer/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Nas: Life Is Good</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/6jb38e3rpRY/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.islanddefjam.com/artist/home.aspx?artistID=7312" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nas&lt;/a&gt; has been disappointing people nearly half his life. By now, the passion play of raised and swiftly dashed hopes that occurs whenever he announces a new album has repeated itself enough times to officially qualify as farce. You'd think he'd be exhausted by now, and there were times over his last three sleepwalking efforts when he sounded just that: a guy wearily familiar with his own towering mythology, and increasingly disinterested in living up to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what if Nas stopped fretting about blowing people's minds or disappointing them and just, you know, &lt;i&gt;made a record&lt;/i&gt;? It's the kind of question Nas devotees have spent years pondering, and &lt;i&gt;Life Is Good&lt;/i&gt;, his 10th studio album and strongest in three or four presidential administrations, is basically the answer. Song for song, it's his most solid, disaster-free album since, well... we won't go there, as comparing Nas albums is like comparing birthdays where your father showed up late instead of not at all. But for once, Nas sidesteps oblivion. &lt;i&gt;Life Is Good&lt;/i&gt; finds him avoiding most of his worst impulses, scraping the pseudo-mystical Righteous Teacher patina off his crown and touching back down in the Queensbridge of his sense memory over late-summer-light production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life Is Good&lt;/i&gt; is so consistent, in fact, that it's disorienting, and those of us with a long history navigating Nas albums will have a lot of pressing questions: What are all these top-shelf beats doing here? Where are the queasy sex jams, the songs rapped from the perspective of heroin spoons or discarded E&amp;amp;J bottles, the choruses about being a Warrior and a Hero? Where is the blindingly ill-fitting Nas Radio Bid? (The lone example, the Swizz Beatz-produced "Summer on Smash", is just inoffensively generic.) But above all: What happened &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the answer is clear. The last few years have been turbulent ones in Nas' personal life -- his brutally public split with Kelis, the costly settlement, the embarrassing fiasco with his teenage daughter tweeting pictures of a bejeweled box of condoms in her bedroom. Historically at his best when shaken, Nas has rich material to work with here, and he's more open-hearted on &lt;i&gt;Life Is Good&lt;/i&gt; than he has been since &lt;i&gt;God's Son&lt;/i&gt;. "Daughters", his sweetly reflective response to the condom-gate that is no less sweet for its slight lyrical awkwardness (he refers to what is presumably Twitter just as &lt;a href="http://tumblinerb.com/post/21904723180" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;"the social network"&lt;/a&gt;), finds him examining the responsibilities of fatherhood with fond bewilderment. The song aimed directly at Kelis ("Bye Baby"), meanwhile, is more a good-times remembrance than score-settling. "You screamin' at the racist cops in Miami was probably the highlight of my life," he recalls, the affection audible in his voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also entirely possible that Nas fans have No I.D. to thank for &lt;i&gt;Life Is Good&lt;/i&gt;'s quality. In &lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/nas-cover-story" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the recent &lt;i&gt;Complex&lt;/i&gt; cover story&lt;/a&gt; on Nas, I.D. said that he "wanted to make a soundtrack that allowed Nas to be Nas." Mentor to Kanye, a Chicago rap veteran, and the current executive vice president at Def Jam, No I.D. seems to be cementing his role as the Rap Whisperer: He recently guided a deeply confused Common to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16156-common-the-dreamerthe-believer/" target="_blank"&gt;his first good record in nine years&lt;/a&gt;, and it's likely he exercised some of the same gentle-but-firm guidance here. He produces five of 14 tracks on &lt;i&gt;Life is Good&lt;/i&gt;, and they all exude the warm TV-fireplace crackle of the best throwback production. You can feel the July city-heat sweat drip off the wooly saxophone on "Stay", while "Back When" flickers like a dim neon sign. The lyrics to "Back When" don't even do much besides gesture at Nas' musty mythology: "check out the oracle bred by city housing," Hollis Ave, Shan, and Marley, "you love to hear the story of how it all got started," etc. But he breathes through it with old-Shakespearean-actor fondness-- he was, after all, there, and No I.D. provides just the right lighting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rest of the production list reads as if it were crowd-sourced by exacting Nas purists: Buckwild, Salaam Remi, the late Heavy D (who gave Nas "The Don" before he passed away). Remi's blaring beat for "A Queens Story" is like a louder, more dramatic version of "Get Down", its tension ratcheted up by James Bond-theme horn blurts. There are a couple of playful, possibly shameless nods to &lt;i&gt;Illmatic&lt;/i&gt;: On the intro to "Loco-Motive", a suspiciously familiar-sounding subway train rolls over tracks in the distance. Nas dedicates the song to "my trapped in the 90s niggas," a line that could be used against him but that sounds, in the album's context, like playfulness. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle, or age backwards, but you can settle gracefully into strengths. Nas isn't &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt;; he's just &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/6jb38e3rpRY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jayson Greene</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16832-life-is-good/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16832-life-is-good/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Baroness: Yellow &amp; Green</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/4VWeitlf8Mc/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When they started making burly, progressive sludge almost 10 years ago, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/" target="_blank"&gt;Baroness&lt;/a&gt; weren't teenagers: They were grown men with a refined, nuanced approach to heavy metal. Even in 2003, it wasn't your typical Southern sludge swamp. That said, I doubt anyone listening then could've predicted &lt;i&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Green&lt;/i&gt;. The quartet's new 18-song, 75-minute double album offers a broad, rich expanse of pretty, psychedelic, occasionally heavy, mostly straight-up rock that veers easily into pop, post-rock, and lulling ambient washes. There are a number of new elements to Baroness in 2012-- frontman John Baizley is the father of a young daughter and lives in Philadelphia instead of Savannah; after the recording of &lt;i&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Green&lt;/i&gt;, Matt Maggioni came on board as the group's new bassist (which means longtime member Summer Welch is no more). The sound itself is the biggest shift, though it shouldn't come as a total surprise. They've hinted at these new avenues, and even tentatively explored a few, on their first two LPs, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13603-blue-record/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue Record&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10646-red-album/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red Album&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What's surprising here is how well it all works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's almost always some filler on a record of this length-- it's a casualty of double albums-- but there's an impressive scarcity of it here. Even the songs that float by more humbly, or as background music, ultimately have a place in the overall dynamic by&amp;#160;the first or second listen. And they are all &lt;i&gt;songs&lt;/i&gt;. Take the "themes" that open &lt;i&gt;Yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Green&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, the warm, aqueous two minutes of "Yellow Theme", the more drifting, airy, chilly (and post-rock anthemic) four-and-a-half minutes of "Green Theme". These are beautiful instrumentals, compositions with actual force and not more incidentals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8886-longform/" target="_blank"&gt;I recently interviewed Baizley&lt;/a&gt; about the record. He detailed how the group's idea of heaviness shifted from their early days to the present. He explained that "tricks" like "10 amplifiers on stage, a ton of volume, and notes on [a] guitar that were more appropriate for bass guitar" were a kind of "artifice to mask youthful songwriting." In the present, the group is more focused on subtlety: "Now that songs have become more important to us, we're trying to find the more nuanced, more appropriate-for-us idea of heavy."&lt;i&gt; Yellow &amp;amp; Green&lt;/i&gt; showcases this new take in spades. As Baizley put it, "the Baroness-circa-2012 definition of heavy [is] not a tuning and it's not necessarily a volume; it's more of a feeling or an idea or some goal post that we're headed towards." And, practically speaking, the cleaner singing is a kind of survival tactic: His and backup vocalist Pete Adams' vocal cords couldn't continue along the raw, shouting path they'd set for themselves earlier on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baizley stressed that, although it's a double LP, &lt;i&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Green&lt;/i&gt; is not a concept record. That said, one theme certainly leaps out: that of aging, and the ways it changes our ideas surrounding music from one stage of adulthood to the next. Albums that force artists to go deep into themselves as people and as musicians tend to end up as accidental concept records, collections that document the time they pushed themselves to create, and the life they were otherwise living at that time. But this one feels very closely aligned to getting closer to 40, to feeling your bones creak a little more, your eyes getting a little weaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's in the lyrics with words that fixate on disappearances, fractures, sleep, bruises, bracing for death, failing hearts, and saying goodnight to your father. Or there's the nostalgia of a line like, "when we were kids we never felt so young, take me to a hazy Sunday morning." Then again, we also get plenty of blood ("this apple makes me sick, says this pig upon the stick, it's my own blood") and water, as both baptism and drowning, or beginning and end. (A track like "March to the Sea" has water in its title, but there's something about its musicality that brings to mind early-1990s post-rock, too, and that post-&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/" target="_blank"&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2217-june-of-44/" target="_blank"&gt;June of 44&lt;/a&gt;-style obsession with anchors and sails.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Congleton, who also produced &lt;i&gt;Blue&lt;/i&gt;, again gels perfectly with the band. Each song has levels and layers: It's an album for headphones as well as one for lighters in the middle of a smoky club. You get weird gurgles of noise, shimmering deep layers of sound, electronic swirls. "Twinkler" is like a downcast campfire greek chorus; "Cocainium" has that kind of ambiance, too, but picks up the drum beat-- it's a variation on psychedelic pop that made me think of the Turtles until the muscular bass, distorted guitars, and grungy chorus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baizley said the cover art, and the songs themselves, reflect the feeling of the moment before or after a disaster; of course, these are very different feelings, but I know what he means. It's not all waiting around and recovering. There's pure climactic catharsis, as you'd expect from Baroness, but these tracks work in a way Baroness songs haven't previously. Instead of explosions, billows, and howls, we get a more meditative air, even on some of the bigger rockers like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13606-take-my-bones-away/" target="_blank"&gt;"Take My Bones Away"&lt;/a&gt; or the rollicking "Board Up the House". Each mountain is chased with something a littler gentler. It's thrilling hearing people this technically adept holding back a little, showing restraint, and cramming what they know into a pop nugget. It's what &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/" target="_blank"&gt;Torche&lt;/a&gt; have done well in the past, especially on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12020-meanderthal/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meanderthal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it's bigger, more spacious and stadium-sized here. (Like if Torche actually were the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/" target="_blank"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of these climaxes is "Eula", the heart-crushing finale to&lt;i&gt; Yellow&lt;/i&gt;, seven minutes of crisp acoustics, atmospheric (and anthemic) vocals, and warped chiming sounds that accompany descriptions of bones breaking, a house becoming a cage-- in other words, the end of something. But it's not: "Eula" ushers in the more pastoral &lt;i&gt;Green&lt;/i&gt;, which also stands on its own as a great record. After the main "Green" theme comes "Board Up the House", a bit of shout-along rock'n'roll with a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/" target="_blank"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt;-like approach to percussive filters and shifts. Elsewhere on this half there's the thorny Fahey-pop of "Stretchmarker" and a dose of chewy pop-metal via "The Line Between", another possible single. It ends with "If I Forget Thee, Lowcountry", an outro like the &lt;i&gt;Yellow&lt;/i&gt; opening: We get that slippery, aqueous sound again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've always liked the elegance of the group's primary-color schemes-- topical, clearly delineated ways to make each album feel like a whole. Here, more than anywhere else, the colors aren't needed: These songs stick together well without a framework. Tracks play off each other, make echoes, and then go on. Each disc stands on its own as a powerful document; together, they genuinely earn the word "epic." During &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYsaZOF1C3A&amp;amp;feature=g-all-a&amp;amp;list=PLBA4F5C8A4E57BFDE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a video interview &lt;/a&gt;we did with the band, Baizley joked that you should go for a run, walk your dog, or otherwise take a break from &lt;i&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Green&lt;/i&gt; at the end of the first half, before venturing into the second. The halves do elegantly mirror each other-- each with its nine songs, intro, and finale-- and a pause could make sense. But I prefer listening to the entire thing from start to finish. This is an impressive effort, one that involved a lot of heavy lifting, and it's best experienced with that sort of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/4VWeitlf8Mc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brandon Stosuy</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16771-yellow-green/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16771-yellow-green/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Frank Ocean: Channel Orange</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/lR0VD-3goSE/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is airborne, looking around, taking it all in. "Up above the birds, I saw the sky like I never seen before," he whispers on his major-label debut, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47015-frank-oceans-album-is-out-digitally-tonight/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as avian chirps surround him. "You thought I was above you." The 24-year-old has quickly proven himself to be among the most gifted singer-songwriters of his generation; he's got the type of voice, wit, charm, smarts, and ineffable humanity that's always hoped for, but never promised. And he's got every reason to think he's above the vividly realized lost souls that slouch, preen, and weep throughout his album. But that's not how Frank Ocean works. His lofty gaze is powerful, but not all-powerful. "What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?" he sang on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch the Throne&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s "No Church in the Wild". He's so good at questioning that answers can't help but bubble up in the wake of his words.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along with Ocean's empathy for his characters is a sense of repose-- he's been there, he's weathered it, and he's come away with his Zen-like calm intact. On &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt;, this serene deadpan is splashed with crackling emotion, as though he's alternately narrating and starring in his own &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magnolia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style cross-wired-heartbreak epic. It's all there on proper opener "Thinkin Bout You", where he battles his own brain while reminiscing about a first love. He tells himself white lies in the verse before flipping to a falsetto that could make D'Angelo sweat for the endless wound of a chorus: "Do you not think so far ahead?/ Cause I've been thinkin bout forever."&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Ocean dropped &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12271-thinking-about-you/" target="_blank"&gt;an early take of "Thinkin Bout You"&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://frankocean.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;his Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; last summer, it was quickly followed by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16130-thinking-about-forever/" target="_blank"&gt;a version&lt;/a&gt; from perfectly competent Roc Nation signee &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29844-bridget-kelly/" target="_blank"&gt;Bridget Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed Ocean originally wrote the song for her. The fact that Ocean's take dwarfs Kelly's both artistically as well as in terms of popularity is telling. After languishing as a behind-the-scenes writer for pop stars including Brandy, John Legend, and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUDstwjItSs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt;, with "Thinkin Bout You" Ocean doubled down on the out-of-nowhere success of his unique and brilliant 2011 mixtape,&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15172-nostalgia-ultra/" target="_blank"&gt;Nostalgia, Ultra.&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;marking his territory as a performer in his own right. And while he's now primarily writing songs for himself, his time toiling in L.A. studios gave him the experience to create a piece as accomplished and varied as &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt;, which swings from Stevie-style keyboard breeziness to 1990s bap&amp;amp;B to mystic psych rock to crunching 8-bit funk without thinking twice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The&amp;#160;"Thinkin Bout You" mix-up was telling for another reason, too. As written, it's by-and-large a unisex composition, and the line, "my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you," didn't seem especially revealing since Ocean wrote the song for a woman. In light of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47067-frank-ocean-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/" target="_blank"&gt;the letter he published earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, in which he stated that his first love, at age 19, was with a man, that line-- and others on the album-- gains some personal and historical context. For a culture that accurately prides itself on sonic progression, hip-hop and R&amp;amp;B can be woefully conservative when it comes to sexuality. This is changing, and Frank Ocean is helping it to change, and if his revelation inspires others to understand themselves or the world more fully, then that could be one of &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt;'s finest legacies. But it will not be the album's only legacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from its bravery, Ocean's letter was, in itself, stunningly written. Its beautiful ambiguities had people reacting with sensational headlines, and then amending those sensational headlines, and then thinking about how and why they personally reacted to such sensational headlines. More questions; more answers. After realizing he was in love with a man, Ocean "reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager. the ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak." And, whether consciously or not, &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt;'s language&amp;#160;is admirably-- and skillfully-- inclusive. Rather than getting listeners to comb through the lyrics for certain words or references, Ocean mixes things up so well-- and coats the entire affair with heavy doses of disorienting surreality-- that petty pronoun policing is rendered completely useless as deeper meanings reveal themselves at the same time.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;While pop is currently in the golden age of exacting self-reflection-- an often beguiling phenomenon spurred on by the internet's infinite mirror-- Ocean is interested in a more selfless pursuit. "As a lifestyle, you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy," Ocean recently told &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/arts/music/frank-oceans-channel-orange.html?_r=2&amp;amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller." Those tales are as wide-ranging as they are engrossing, always benefitting from Ocean's eye for detail and specificity. There are sly California class observations in the vein of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joan Didion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/" target="_blank"&gt;Randy Newman&lt;/a&gt;, where latchkey "Super Rich Kids" can't see past their own one-percent &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13843-sweet-life/" target="_blank"&gt;"Sweet Life"&lt;/a&gt;. But once again, Ocean isn't just sniping easy targets; "why see the world when you got the beach?" he asks, a Rorschach test of a hook that leaves its levels of bliss or cynicism wholly up to the listener.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of addicts on the back half of the album: the fiend at the center of "Crack Rock" whose family "stopped inviting you to things" and "won't let you hold their infant," or the poisoned relationship between a dealer and his mule on "Lost". On the record's most harrowing cut, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13865-bad-religion/" target="_blank"&gt;"Bad Religion"&lt;/a&gt;, Ocean is crippled by love and left searching for life's answers in the back of a cab-- the string-bleeding ballad finds the singer offering his most impassioned plea yet: "This unrequited love/ To me it's nothing but a one man cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup/ I could never make him love me."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;is stuffed with one-of-a-kind details and characters, its overall scope is grand, as is Ocean's. Tape-hiss interludes bind these very hi-fi songs together with a musty analog quality, and a couple of tracks seem to end mid-sentence, leaving you no choice but to keep going. And there's a timeless philosophy involved here, one of hard-won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them. How else to explain &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13733-pyramids/" target="_blank"&gt;"Pyramids"&lt;/a&gt;, a 10-minute time warp that goes from ancient Egyptian wonders to modern strip clubs and essentially reincarnates one of the most storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. But still, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"holding my head. keeping it g [...] whatever 'keeping it g' means to me. i've sorta zoned in on my own definition." Frank &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frank_ocean/status/151811997212741632" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;wrote that&lt;/a&gt; on December 27, 2011-- the same day he wrote the "first love" letter he published last week. Both missives, along with &lt;i&gt;Channel Orange&lt;/i&gt; itself, carry the same spirit of confident, open-minded redefinition; he's living in his own world, but also fascinated with what's around him. Currently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frank_ocean/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;his Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt; reads: "i don't know anything. &amp;amp; neither do you." In Frank Ocean-speak, that's not a statement of ignorance but rather one of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/lR0VD-3goSE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ryan Dombal</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dirty Projectors: Swing Lo Magellan</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/72uV2T-QQDY/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you've only tuned in for parts of&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/" target="_blank"&gt;Dirty Projectors&lt;/a&gt;' decade-long run, it's entirely possible that you've viewed bandleader Dave Longstreth and his ever-evolving band line-up as a gimmick. After all, though Longstreth had been releasing music as Dirty Projectors for years, the band finally inched toward a critical mass in 2007 on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10577-rise-above/" target="_blank"&gt;an album that reinterpreted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/" target="_blank"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;Damaged&lt;/i&gt; from memory. The album found Longstreth replacing Rollins' gruff bellow with alien, elastic vocals, anchored to the zigs and zags of West African guitar. Two years later, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bitte Orca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used a trio of female vocalists-- mainstays Amber Coffman and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27671-deradoorian/" target="_blank"&gt;Angel Deradoorian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and newcomer Haley Dekle-- to bait often abstruse arrangements and hard-to-parse lyrics. When &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/" target="_blank"&gt;Questlove&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/09/dirty_projector_22.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a backstage video&lt;/a&gt; of the Projectors performing an unplugged "When the World Comes to an End" after a "Late Night with&amp;#160;Jimmy Fallon" appearance, internet commentators concurred that people simply shouldn't be able to sing like that. Between the intercalated harmonies, Longstreth's own sometimes-stringent tone, and his counterintuitive approach to guitar, Dirty Projectors occasionally could be reduced into a menagerie of eccentricities-- possible to enjoy, but sometimes difficult to internalize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swing Lo Magellan&lt;/i&gt; should help rectify that: The band's least ornate batch of songs to date builds upon Longstreth's most direct and identifiable lyrics ever. Which means that Dirty Projectors have upped their emotional and structural accessibility all at once. Culled from a batch of roughly 40 demos, these tunes explore vulnerability and vexation, sweetness and cynicism with more manageable musical complications than ever before. For instance,&amp;#160;the gorgeous "Impregnable Question"&amp;#160;finds the seam between &lt;i&gt;Heart of Gold&lt;/i&gt;-era &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; and late-1960s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/" target="_blank"&gt;Serge Gainsbourg&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;#160;it's a love song between Coffman and Longstreth, her coos helping him to soften his voice above a warm acoustic shuffle. Over handclaps and a ragged, wrapping riff on "Dance for You", Longstreth offers one of his most intuitive and immediate hooks. There's gusto and playfulness here, too, from the way Longstreth clears his very-warped throat before launching into the first verse of opener "Offspring Are Blank" to the brilliant decision to record Coffman and Dekle mocking some of Longstreth's most impenetrable lyrics toward the end of the irrepressible "Unto Caesar". When he sings "Down the line/ Dead, the martyrs' morbid poetry," Coffman teasingly answers, "Uhh, that doesn't make any sense, what you just said." You want to be in the room with this band.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's also a folk-song seriousness at work on some of the standouts, especially the tragic "Just From Chevron". Structured so that Coffman and Dekle play the part of a Greek chorus while Longstreth sings the dying narrator's plight in soliloquy, the song is a fitting one for this year of &lt;a href="http://www.woody100.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Woody Guthrie centennial&lt;/a&gt; celebrations. &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/03/21/chevron-calls-brazil-oilspill-lawsuit-outrageous/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chevron-- or any company, for that matter&lt;/a&gt;--&amp;#160;has brainwashed its employee so that, as he lays dying due to their own mechanical failure, he needs his love not to know that he loves her but that his death is worthwhile, because it's part of the company's quest to power the world. A devastating fact in a field of general abstraction, it's as poignant and profound as anything Dirty Projectors have ever released. The title track works a similar mode, with its buttoned-up rhythm section holding steady alongside lyrics about the clutches of conformity and the liberation of self-reflection. "In the grid, aware their position," Longstreth sings, any possible scorn swallowed in genuine worry. "Unconcerned with intuition."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's not to say that all of these arrangements are exactly intuitive. After all, this is still Dirty Projectors, and this is still an album whose first single, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13379-gun-has-no-trigger/" target="_blank"&gt;"Gun Has No Trigger"&lt;/a&gt;, is an unnerved look at the way things might have been and whose rhythm doesn't shift once. The tricky meter that underpins "About to Die" is quintessential Dirty Projectors, as are the two-part harmonies bouncing against Longstreth's young-love paranoia. "Maybe That Was It" even inches toward psychedelic rock. Longstreth's falsetto comes refracted through a web of effects, providing a suitable counter for the Crazy Horse-like stumbling stagger and craggy electric lead. Even the straightforward Dirty Projectors are still a mighty complex unit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swing Lo Magellan&lt;/i&gt; is a confident step into the spotlight that neither depends upon public expectations nor shies away from them. It's well-made but certainly not over-produced, idiosyncratic and intricate but very rarely obtuse. But as compelling as these tunes and these performances often are, what's most intriguing about &lt;i&gt;Swing Lo Magellan&lt;/i&gt; is the way it suggests that, even after a decade, we still don't know everything about Longstreth or his band. If, in the past, he or they sometimes seemed like a freak show, they come toward Earth just enough here to feel like a proper rock band working in service of songs about love and confusion, anxiety and celebration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a society of by-the-second news updates and endless information all the time, it's strangely reassuring to feel as if a songwriter who's been&amp;#160;endlessly&amp;#160;interrogated, analyzed, and publicized is still something of a stranger. Longstreth himself seems to serve as the narrator of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13766-dance-for-you/" target="_blank"&gt;"Dance for You"&lt;/a&gt;, an ebullient account of an odyssey for a grail that exists but has yet to be found. "There is an answer," reckons Longstreth, his voice rising optimistically over film-score strings. "I haven't found it/ But I will keep dancing until I do." This far into a career, that's a good thing not only to hear a songwriter sing but a mantra to hear him create by, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/72uV2T-QQDY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Grayson Currin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16806-swing-lo-magellan/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16806-swing-lo-magellan/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Twin Shadow: Confess</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~3/mbxhkpvXZl4/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about the man who writes &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/" target="_blank"&gt;Twin Shadow&lt;/a&gt; songs, but the man &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;them doesn't really seem like a good dude. In fact, he's a total dick most of the time. "I don't want to believe or be in love," was George Lewis Jr.'s climactic mission statement on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11967-slow/" target="_blank"&gt;"Slow"&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14675-forget/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forget&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; negated its new romantic sounds with accounts of people who chose to ignore his warning. There was the girl who promised to "never let another black boy break [her] heart" and became the subject of "Tyrant Destroyed", and then there was the partner in crime on "Shooting Holes", who took her father's gun and was sworn into secrecy. And as a message to the fellas, there was &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11984-i-cant-wait/" target="_blank"&gt;"I Can't Wait"&lt;/a&gt;, where Lewis stole your girl from right under your armpit because she hated your moves, the implication being that she was going to love his. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This persona played a huge role in distinguishing &lt;i&gt;Forget,&lt;/i&gt; despite much evidence of it being wholly of Brooklyn, ca. 2010: &lt;i&gt;Pretty in Pink &lt;/i&gt;sonic nostalgia, a cosign from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/" target="_blank"&gt;Grizzly Bear&lt;/a&gt;, smeared cover art. But in light of brash interviews and surprisingly torrid live shows, Lewis' careerist ambition, pretty boy swagger, and leering libido made clear he was not long for the world of back-patting, hand-holding indie rock. You might find the bad-boy posturing on &lt;i&gt;Confess&lt;/i&gt;' cover too blatant in announcing Lewis' arrival as a self-identifying pop idol, but he refuses to apologize for anything here: not his brash lyrics, laser-focused songwriting, or glossy production. It's a purposefully arrogant star turn that would otherwise be insufferable if &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;didn't make it abundantly clear that Lewis is one of the few guys out there capable of living up to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;He's adjusting his role models to fit the situation, staying within the 80s but moving from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/" target="_blank"&gt;the Psychedelic Furs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4072-simple-minds/" target="_blank"&gt;Simple Minds&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he's taking &lt;i&gt;Purple Rain, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/" target="_blank"&gt;Born in the U.S.A. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Lost Boys &lt;/i&gt;as guides. We're talking leather jackets, sullen glowers, salvation through hit-making. And &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;aspires to the excess of the Reagan years, when all genres were competing for the same MTV slots and the production on pop, rock, and R&amp;amp;B records was essentially the same. But while &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;is slick, it doesn't sound slavishly retro or expensive; in fact, there's a eerie, disembodied artificiality to many of these sounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Lewis' rangy vocals rightfully remain at the forefront-- sultry and vulnerable in their lower reaches, with a clarion burst in its higher notes that recalls both &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/" target="_blank"&gt;TV on the Radio&lt;/a&gt;'s Tunde Adebimpe. But nearly every other sound is so crisp and airless that they become compellingly dehumanized. The snares during the disparaging chorus of "Golden Light" hit like open-hand slaps or a glass of cold water to the face, and harsh digital clipping on the kick drums and vocals express the claustrophobic lust of "You Call Me On". "I Don't Care" underlines the startling cruelty of its lyrics with a coda of grunts. "The One" is a rare moment of devotion communicated with blinding acoustic glare, while the exaggerated courtship of "Beg For the Night" accents its chorus with the utmost of new-money sounds, the orchestra hit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On a purely sonic level, &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;will tell you "greed is good," and it's underlined by the economy of the songwriting, which shows a clear progression from the occasionally stunning but unbalanced &lt;i&gt;Forget.&lt;/i&gt; The 10 songs on &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;operate only in power moves, the verses sneering, seducing, doing whatever they can to draw the listener in before every choruses ascends and explodes. Having recorded nearly all of &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;by himself, you hear a perfectionist's internal competition in Lewis, each song subject to merciless editing to assure that if he realizes the death wish alluded to in the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/46897-watch-the-video-for-twin-shadows-five-seconds/" target="_blank"&gt;"Five Seconds" video&lt;/a&gt;, he'll leave a beautiful corpse and a record of 10 fail-proof singles. It's textbook, time-honored stuff, but it's rarely done at this level. Whether it's the lush power-balladry of "Beg For the Night" and "Be Mine Tonight" or throttle-pushing rockers like "You Call Me On", &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;is defined by its melodic and emotional immediacy. This is no where more evident than it is on the cyclical refrain of the all-hook single "Five Seconds"-- "straight to the heart."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The ruthless efficiency extends to the lyrics, and this is what ultimately gives &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;its edge, pushing it into something more illicitly alluring. It's indeed a hyper-masculine record, almost every single lyric occurring at a relationship flashpoint between Lewis and a royal female "you" whose lust only confirms her misunderstanding of him. Combined with his refusal to sugarcoat anything, the first instinct is to assume it's a misogynist record as well, but &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;isn't macho or "bro." The songs are about dishonesty and what is revealed in desiring love but acting out of lust. The arrangement of "Golden Light" takes its cues from the secular uplift of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/" target="_blank"&gt;Arcade Fire&lt;/a&gt; while flipping the carnal chorus of "Atomic Dog" into something simultaneously metaphysical and cynical-- "Some people say you're the golden light/ And if I chase after you, doesn't mean it's true." It's all to easy to hear a lyric like "I don't give a damn about your dreams/ A whole world that is falling at the seams" from "You Call Me On" as pitiless. But there's an equanimity to Lewis' viewpoint as he offers "that's what it's supposed to do" as a stark epigram of cold comfort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And he gets as good as he gives, rarely painting himself as a savior or even someone worthy of envy. "Patient" describes a no-strings fling that you'd think would be the optimum scenario in a Twin Shadow song, but the refusal to define it as such is torture for Lewis and you can hear it in &lt;i&gt;Confess&lt;/i&gt;' most over the top arrangement, a bridge cobbling together drumline snares, a shredding guitar, and a push of his 80s influences somewhere towards New Jack Swing. Twin Shadow gets into darker metal-R&amp;amp;B territory on "I Don't Care" whose superficially shocking admonishments to a morally suspect woman brings it awfully close to "Dirty Diana" territory. But "I Don't Care", like most of &lt;i&gt;Confess&lt;/i&gt;, doesn't sound ego-fueled or even hateful. Lovers on &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;are equal co-conspirators, liars, fully complicit and bent on mutually assured destruction. Records from the likes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/" target="_blank"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/" target="_blank"&gt;the Weeknd&lt;/a&gt; have been instructive on how to toast to groin-led douchebags. But there's little hedonism or depravity here. On &lt;i&gt;Confess&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sex is dispassionately viewed like any addictive substance, one that basically destroys people who use it to fill a spiritual void.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This corrosive thread running throughout &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;helps illustrate the difference in intent between Twin Shadow's two simply titled albums. &lt;i&gt;Forget &lt;/i&gt;hinted at traumatic experiences that Lewis was trying to process years after the fact and figured he'd be better off ignoring, whereas &lt;i&gt;Confess &lt;/i&gt;doesn't actually cop to much-- just the challenge to "say just what you mean and give up everything." So then it's curious that during one of the softer moments of &lt;i&gt;Confess&lt;/i&gt;, Lewis admits, "I'll cry when the movie's over." He's the cocky, successful, brutally honest lothario who almost always gets his comeuppance in cinema and is verboten in indie rock. But this is pop music where the bad guy wins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PitchforkBestNewAlbums/~4/mbxhkpvXZl4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16805-confess/</guid><feedburner:origLink>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16805-confess/</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
