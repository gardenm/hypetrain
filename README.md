hypetrain
=========

Aggregator for music reviews, with links to Rdio for more info, streaming, etc.

Includes some rake tasks (lib/tasks/hypetrain.rake) for pulling review info from Metacritic and Pitchfork, and for linking those reviewed albums to Rdio.

TODO: Lots, including sprucing up the UI, allowing a user to log in and link to their Rdio account, maybe some recommendation stuff...
